# What is Java?

Java is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and widely used for building software applications. It was created by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle. One of the main features of Java is its platform independence, meaning that Java code can run on any operating system, such as Windows, Mac, or Linux, without needing to be rewritten.

## Key Features of Java:
- **Works on any platform**: Java code can run on any operating system without needing to be changed.
- **Object-Oriented**: Java uses a style of programming that helps organize code and make it reusable.
- **Reliable and Safe**: Java has built-in tools to make sure the code runs smoothly and securely.
- **Multithreading**: Java can run multiple tasks at the same time, making it more efficient.
- **Big Library**: Java has a huge collection of ready-to-use tools and functions to make programming easier.

## Real-Life Example:
### Android Apps:
Android Development: Java is one of the main languages used to build Android apps. When you download a new app from the Google Play Store, it’s usually written in Java or Kotlin, which works seamlessly with Java. Java allows the app to work on all Android phones, regardless of the brand or model.

## Conclusion:
Java is a popular programming language because it's easy to use, can run on any computer or phone, and is perfect for building everything from websites to mobile apps.

# Why Java?

Java is a very popular programming language for several important reasons. Let's break them down:

## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **What it means**: Java uses the concept of objects and classes. An object is like a real-world thing (like a car or a person), and a class is like a blueprint that defines what an object will look like and what it can do.

- **Why it's good**: By organizing code into objects and classes, Java makes it easier to manage large projects. You can reuse code, so you don't have to rewrite the same thing again. It also helps break down complex tasks into smaller, easier-to-understand parts. This leads to cleaner, more organized code that’s easier to maintain and expand.

## 2. Platform Independence

- **What it means**: Java code is turned into a special format called bytecode when it’s written. This bytecode can run on any computer or device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, no matter what type of operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) it’s using.

- **Why it's good**: This is why Java is called "write once, run anywhere." You can write your program once, and it will work on any computer or device, without having to rewrite or change the code for each platform. It saves time and makes your program more flexible.

## 3. Security

- **What it means**: Java comes with built-in features to keep your code and data safe. It has things like automatic memory management (to avoid memory errors), encryption (to protect sensitive data), and secure class loading (to make sure harmful code doesn’t get executed).

- **Why it's good**: These security features make Java a great choice for building secure applications, such as online banking systems, e-commerce websites, and anything that deals with sensitive personal data. Java helps protect against things like hacking or accidental data loss.

## 4. Multithreading

- **What it means**: Java can do many tasks at the same time using multithreading. This means a program can perform multiple actions at once, like downloading files and playing music at the same time, without freezing or slowing down.

- **Why it's good**: Multithreading improves the performance of your programs, especially those that need to respond quickly, like video games, media players, or communication apps (like chat apps). It helps make your programs more efficient and faster.

## 5. Large Ecosystem and Libraries

- **What it means**: Java has a large collection of pre-written code (called libraries) that developers can use to perform common tasks. For example, Java has libraries for connecting to databases, managing user interfaces, or handling networks.

- **Why it's good**: These libraries save time by providing ready-made solutions for common problems. Instead of writing everything from scratch, developers can use these libraries to focus on the unique parts of their project, making development faster and easier.

Real-time Example: Banking Applications

Java is commonly used in online banking systems because it provides strong security features that help protect sensitive information. Here's how it works:

Security of User Data: Java helps ensure that important information like your bank account number, passwords, and transaction details are kept safe. It uses encryption, which is like putting your data in a locked box, so only authorized users can access it.

Secure Transactions: When you make a payment or transfer money online, Java helps secure the transaction by making sure that no one can tamper with the data while it’s being sent over the internet. This prevents fraud and ensures that your financial information stays private.

# Where is Java Used?

Java is a versatile programming language, used in many areas of technology. Here’s where Java is commonly used:

## 1. Web Applications (Backend)
- **What it means**: Java is often used to build the backend of websites and web applications. This means Java runs the server-side tasks, like processing requests, interacting with databases, and sending data to the frontend (what users see).
- **Real-world example**: Large websites, like banking systems or e-commerce sites, use Java to make sure everything works behind the scenes smoothly.

## 2. Mobile Applications (Android)
- **What it means**: Java is the main language used for building Android apps. These are the apps that run on smartphones and tablets.
- **Real-world example**: Many popular Android apps, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, are built using Java.

## 3. Embedded Systems
- **What it means**: Java is also used in small devices like printers, smart TVs, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These devices need to run specific tasks, and Java is often used because it's lightweight and efficient.
- **Real-world example**: Java can be found in things like smart home devices and certain wearable technology.

## Real-time Example:

### Online Shopping Websites
- **How it's used**: Websites like Amazon and eBay use Java for the backend. Java handles important tasks like managing inventory, processing payments, and ensuring user accounts are secure.

### Enterprise Applications
- **How it's used**: Large companies use Java to build systems that manage resources, track inventory, and handle business functions, like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems.

Java is everywhere, from the websites you shop on, to the apps you use, and even to the small devices in your home.
-----
# When Should You Use Java?

You should choose Java when:

## 1. You need platform independence
- **What it means**: If you want your program to run on different operating systems (like Windows, Mac, Linux) without changes, Java is a great choice because it works anywhere.

## 2. You’re building a large, complex application
- **What it means**: Java is ideal for developing big, complex systems that require scalability and reliability, such as customer management or financial systems. 

## 3. Security is important
- **What it means**: Java has strong security features to protect sensitive data, making it the right choice for building secure applications, like payment processing or online banking.

## Real-time Example:

### Enterprise Solutions
- **How it's used**: Companies such as banks and large retailers use Java to build systems that manage millions of transactions and sensitive data daily. For example, Java is used in CRM systems to store customer details and process orders.

### Online Games and Trading Systems
- **How it's used**: Java is used in high-speed trading platforms and large multiplayer online games because it can handle large amounts of data and transactions quickly and securely.

# How Java Works: From Source Code to Execution

Java works in a unique way that allows it to run on any device, anywhere. Let’s break down the process of how Java code is compiled, converted into bytecode, and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), using a simple "Hello World" program as an example.

---

## 1. **Writing the Java Code (Source Code)**

First, a Java programmer writes the source code, which is a simple text file. For example, here's a simple "Hello World" Java program:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
### What Happens?
- This code is written in **human-readable Java syntax**.
- It’s saved with the `.java` extension, like `HelloWorld.java`.
- This is **source code**, which needs to be translated into machine-readable instructions.

# 2. Compilation (Source Code to Bytecode)

Once the Java program is written, it must be compiled into bytecode. This is done using the Java Compiler (`javac`).

### What Happens?
- You run the `javac HelloWorld.java` command, which invokes the Java compiler.
- The compiler translates the `.java` file into bytecode and saves it as a `.class` file, like `HelloWorld.class`.
- The bytecode is a set of instructions that the JVM can understand and execute, but it's not tied to any specific operating system or hardware. It's platform-independent.

### Why Bytecode?
- **Platform Independence**: The bytecode is not specific to any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.), so it can be run on any system that has a JVM.


# 3. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Now that the Java program is compiled into bytecode, it needs to be executed. The JVM comes into play.

### What Happens?
- The JVM is a special program that runs on the computer and knows how to interpret the bytecode.
- When you run the command `java HelloWorld`, the JVM loads the bytecode from `HelloWorld.class`.
- The JVM then translates the bytecode into machine code (binary code) that the computer's processor understands. This machine code is platform-specific (it depends on the OS and hardware), but the JVM handles the translation for you.


# 4. Execution (Bytecode to Machine Code)

### What Happens?
- The JVM executes the bytecode line by line, translating each instruction into machine code.
- For example, the command `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` sends an instruction to the JVM to print "Hello, World!" to the screen.
- The JVM translates this into the appropriate machine instructions (binary code) that will make the operating system display the message.

# 5. Memory Management and Garbage Collection

While the program is running, the JVM also manages memory. It allocates memory for objects and handles garbage collection, which means it automatically cleans up memory that is no longer in use.

### What Happens?
- If your program creates objects or uses resources (like memory), the JVM will automatically free up the memory once the objects are no longer needed.
- This ensures that your program doesn’t use more memory than it should, avoiding crashes or memory leaks.


# Real-time Example: Java in Web Servers

Java is widely used in web servers like Tomcat or JBoss. Let’s say you're visiting an online shopping website:

The backend server of the website runs Java code to handle requests like:
- User logins
- Fetching product data from a database
- Processing payments

These Java applications are compiled into bytecode and executed by the JVM. The JVM ensures that the server can run smoothly regardless of the operating system (Windows, Linux, etc.) on which it is hosted.

### Platform Independence with Web Servers
When a user requests to view a product, the Java backend code processes this request:
- The bytecode is interpreted by the JVM.
- It translates into machine-specific code to retrieve product details.
- The machine code sends the data back to the user’s browser.

This shows the power of Java's platform independence, where the same bytecode works on various operating systems and hardware platforms.


# From Source Code to Bytecode and Machine Code

### Java Code → Bytecode:
1. **HelloWorld.java** is written by the programmer.
2. The Java compiler (`javac`) converts the source code into bytecode and saves it in a `.class` file.

### Bytecode → JVM → Machine Code:
1. The JVM takes the bytecode from `HelloWorld.class`.
2. The JVM translates the bytecode into machine code (binary format) that the computer can understand and execute.

### JVM Execution:
1. The JVM handles the execution of the program. 
2. For example, it translates `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` into machine code that instructs the computer to display the message on the screen.

# Summary of the Process:

### Compilation:
- Java source code → Bytecode (using `javac HelloWorld.java`).

### Execution:
- Bytecode → JVM → Machine Code (using `java HelloWorld`).

### JVM:
- Handles the translation and execution of the bytecode, memory management, and garbage collection.

This entire process is what makes Java platform-independent. The "write once, run anywhere" philosophy means that once the Java program is compiled into bytecode, it can run on any system with a JVM, regardless of the operating system or hardware.

# Understanding JVM, JDK, and JRE

### 1. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
**What**: The **JVM** is a virtual machine that allows Java programs to run on any device or operating system by interpreting compiled Java bytecode. It is platform-independent and provides an environment for Java applications to execute.
  
- **Why**: It ensures that Java code is portable, meaning it can run on any platform that has a JVM implementation. This is the cornerstone of Java’s “write once, run anywhere” philosophy.
  
- **When**: The JVM is used **whenever** Java bytecode needs to be executed. After compiling the Java source code, the JVM runs it on the target machine.

- **Where**: The JVM is installed on the **end-user’s machine** or the **server** where the Java program will run. It is typically included with the JRE.

- **How**: The JVM takes the bytecode, interprets it, and translates it into machine-specific code for execution on the hardware.

#### Visualization:
Think of the JVM as a **translator**. Your Java program (written in Java language) is like a message in English. The JVM translates this message into a format that your computer can understand (machine code).

---

### 2. **JDK (Java Development Kit)**
- **What**: The **JDK** is a software development kit that includes everything you need to develop Java applications: the compiler, the JVM, libraries, and tools to build, debug, and deploy Java applications.
  
- **Why**: If you’re a developer, the JDK provides all the tools necessary to write, compile, and debug your Java programs. Without the JDK, you can't write or compile Java code.
  
- **When**: You use the **JDK** when you are **developing** Java programs (writing and compiling source code).

- **Where**: The JDK is installed on a **developer's machine** to facilitate the creation of Java applications.

- **How**: The JDK includes a compiler (`javac`) to compile Java code into bytecode, which can then be executed by the JVM. It also includes other tools like debuggers and profilers to aid in the development process.

#### 3. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**
- **What**: The **JRE** is a runtime environment that allows you to run Java applications. It includes the JVM and essential libraries but does not provide development tools like the JDK.

- **Why**: The JRE is needed to run Java applications. It contains the JVM that interprets bytecode and provides the necessary libraries for Java programs to function.

- **When**: You need the **JRE** when you want to **run** Java applications but not develop them (no need for compiling).

- **Where**: The JRE is typically installed on **end-user machines** or **servers** where Java applications will be executed.

- **How**: The JRE includes the JVM, which runs Java bytecode, and the set of libraries that the Java program depends on for its execution.
#### Contains:
- **JVM**: The virtual machine that runs your Java code.
- **JRE**: The runtime environment that allows you to run Java programs.
- **Development Tools**: Compilers, debuggers, and other tools for writing Java code.

#### Visualization:
Imagine you’re going to bake a cake. The **JDK** is like a complete kitchen with all the tools (baking pan, oven, etc.) and ingredients (flour, sugar, etc.) you need to bake the cake (develop Java code). The **JVM** is the oven that actually bakes the cake (runs your code), and the **JRE** is the ingredients to make the cake (provides the environment to run the code).


---

## Scenario: A Simple Java Program

Let’s say you are a developer who has written a Java program to calculate the sum of two numbers.

1. **Step 1**: You write your Java code (source code).
   ```java
   public class Sum {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           int a = 5;
           int b = 10;
           System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
       }
   }
   ```
 2. **Step 2**: Compile the Java Code Using the JDK
The compiler (part of the JDK) converts the Java code into bytecode (a .class file).  
   ```javac Sum.java
```
3. **Step 3**: Execute the Bytecode with the JVM
The JVM takes the bytecode and executes it on your machine. The JVM translates the bytecode into machine code that your system can execute.
 ```java Sum
```
```Sum: 15
```
If you just want to run this program (without modifying it), you would need the JRE, as it contains the JVM and libraries required for execution.
If you want to develop the program (write and compile it), you would need the JDK.
## **Comparison of JDK, JVM, and JRE**

- **JDK:** Includes everything you need to develop **and** run Java applications (both the **JRE** and tools like the **compiler**).
- **JRE:** Includes everything you need to **run** Java applications (just the **JVM** and libraries).
- **JVM:** The virtual machine that executes the **bytecode** and translates it into **machine code** for your system.

## **Summary with Simple Example**

Let’s say you want to create a simple **Java-based Calculator** app:

- **JDK** is your toolbox. You use it to **write** the Java code, **compile** it, and **debug** any issues.
- **JVM** is like the **engine** of your app. It takes the compiled bytecode and runs it on your computer, so you can use the app.
- **JRE** is like a **ready-made engine** that only helps you run apps that are already compiled. If you only want to **use** the Calculator app (but not create it), you'd need the **JRE**, not the full **JDK**.

## **How These Work Together:**
1. You write the **Calculator app code** (Java file).
2. You compile the code using **JDK** (which creates bytecode).
3. The **JVM** then runs the bytecode, executing the app on your computer.
4. If you're just running the app, you'd need the **JRE** installed, which includes the **JVM**.

### **In Summary:**
- **JDK = Full toolbox for Java development** (including compiler and JVM).
- **JRE = Environment for running Java programs** (includes JVM).
- **JVM = The engine that runs the Java program** (translates bytecode into machine code).

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
# Java HelloWorld Program Explanation

## 1. `public`
**Meaning**: `public` is an access modifier. It defines the visibility or accessibility of the class, method, or variable.

**Elaboration**: 
- When you declare a class or method as `public`, it means that it can be accessed from anywhere. In this case, it means that the `HelloWorld` class can be accessed by other classes, regardless of where those classes are in the codebase.
- In the context of the main method: `public` ensures that the `main` method can be accessed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to start the program when it is executed.

---

## 2. `class`
**Meaning**: `class` is a keyword in Java that defines a class.

**Elaboration**: 
- A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It contains fields (variables) and methods (functions) that define the behavior of the objects. 
- In this case, the class is named `HelloWorld`.
- In the context of `HelloWorld`: This keyword signifies that we're defining a class named `HelloWorld`, and everything inside the curly braces `{}` will belong to this class.

---

## 3. `HelloWorld`
**Meaning**: `HelloWorld` is the name of the class.

**Elaboration**:
- In Java, class names follow the PascalCase convention, where the first letter of each word is capitalized. The name `HelloWorld` is what identifies the class, and it will be used when referring to this class or creating an object of this class.
- In the context of the program: `HelloWorld` is the class that contains the main method. When you run the program, the JVM will look for the `HelloWorld` class and the `main` method within it.

---

## 4. `{` and `}`
**Meaning**: These curly braces `{}` are used to define the body of the class and method.

**Elaboration**:
- In Java, blocks of code, such as classes, methods, and loops, are enclosed in curly braces. These braces indicate where a particular section of code begins and ends.
- In the context of the program: The first set of curly braces `{}` marks the beginning and end of the `HelloWorld` class, while the second set `{}` within it marks the beginning and end of the `main` method.

---

## 5. `public static void main(String[] args)`
**Meaning**: This is the entry point of a Java application. It’s the method that is executed when you run the Java program.

**Elaboration**:
- `public`: As mentioned earlier, this makes the method accessible from outside the class, specifically by the JVM when executing the program.
- `static`: This means that the method belongs to the class itself rather than to instances (objects) of the class. You don’t need to create an instance of the `HelloWorld` class to run the `main` method.
- `void`: This means that the method does not return any value. It is a return type that signifies no value will be returned after execution.
- `main`: This is the name of the method. In Java, the `main` method is special because it is the entry point of any Java application. It’s where execution begins.
- `String[] args`: This is an array of command-line arguments that can be passed when running the program. `String[]` represents an array of String objects. `args` is the name of the variable that holds these arguments. You can pass values to the program when running it from the command line.

In the context of the program: The `main` method is called automatically by the JVM when you run the `HelloWorld` program. It is the starting point where the program begins execution.

---

## 6. `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`
**Meaning**: This statement prints text to the console.

**Elaboration**:
- `System`: This is a built-in Java class in the `java.lang` package. It provides various utility functions, such as accessing standard input, output, and error streams.
- `out`: This is a static field of the `System` class that refers to the standard output stream (usually the console or terminal).
- `println`: This is a method of the `out` object. It stands for "print line," and it prints the specified text or value followed by a new line.
- `"Hello, World!"`: This is a string literal that specifies the text to be printed. The quotation marks indicate that it is a string.

In the context of the program: The statement `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` tells the program to print `"Hello, World!"` to the console when the program runs. The `println` method also moves the cursor to the next line after printing the text, so if you add more print statements, each will appear on a new line.

---

## 7. `;`
**Meaning**: This is the semicolon symbol, used to mark the end of a statement in Java.

**Elaboration**: 
- Every statement in Java, such as variable declarations, method calls, and assignments, must be terminated with a semicolon. It indicates the end of a complete statement.
- In the context of the program: The semicolon marks the end of the `println` statement.

---

## Putting It All Together
- `public class HelloWorld`: This defines the class `HelloWorld` as public and marks the start of the class body.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This defines the `main` method, the entry point of the Java program.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`: This prints `"Hello, World!"` to the console.

# Understanding Data Types in Java
# What is a Variable?

A **variable** is like a box or container where you store data. Every variable has:

1. **A name** – so you can refer to it later.
2. **A data type** – which defines what kind of data it will hold (like numbers, text, etc.).
3. **A value** – the actual data inside the variable.

### Example:

```java
int age = 25;
```
- ```age``` is the variable name.
- ```int``` is the data type (which tells Java that age will store a whole number).
- ```25``` is the value stored in the variable.

# Why Do We Need Data Types?

**Data types** tell Java what kind of data you are working with and help the program know how to process that data. Without data types, Java wouldn't know how to treat the information.

### Examples:
- You **can’t store text** in a number variable.
- You **can’t perform mathematical operations** on text without converting it to a number first.

### Without data types:

```java
int age = "twenty";  // Error: You can't store text in an integer variable
```
```java
int age = 25;         // Correct: age is an integer
String name = "John"; // Correct: name is a string

```



---

### Two Main Categories of Data Types in Java

Java has two broad categories of data types:
1. **Primitive Data Types**  : These store simple values like numbers or a single character.
2. **Reference Data Types** : These store complex data like objects or arrays.

---

## 1. Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the most basic building blocks for storing data. Java has 8 types of primitive data types. Let’s look at each one with examples.

### a) byte
- **What is it?** A tiny number that can range from -128 to 127.
- **Size:** It takes up only 1 byte of memory.
- **Example:** 
  ```java
  byte age = 25;
- Use: It’s used when you need to store very small numbers and save memory.

### b) short

- **What is it?**  A slightly larger number, ranging from -32,768 to 32,767.
- **Size:** Takes up 2 bytes of memory.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  short temperature = -5;
- Use: Useful for small numbers, and when memory is a concern.

### c) int

- **What is it?** A common number type for whole numbers.
- **Size:** 4 bytes (32 bits).
- **Example:**
  ```java
  int distance = 100000;
- Use: Most commonly used for numbers that don’t have decimals.

### d) long
- **What is it?** A big number.
- **Size:** Takes up 8 bytes.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  long population = 7800000000L;
- Use: Used when numbers are too large to fit in an int.

### e) float
- **What is it?** A number with decimals (but not super precise).
- **Size:** Takes up 4 bytes.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  float price = 9.99f;
- Use: Used for decimal numbers when you don’t need a lot of precision.

### f) double
- **What is it?** A more precise decimal number.
- **Size:** Takes up 8 bytes.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  double salary = 1500.75;
- Use: The default data type for decimal numbers in Java.

### g) char
- **What is it?** A single character.
- **Size:** Takes up 2 bytes.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  char grade = 'A';
- Use: Used to store a single character, like a letter or number.

### h) boolean
- **What is it?** A value that can only be true or false.
- **Size:** Takes up 1 byte.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  boolean isAdult = true;
- Use: Used to represent a decision, yes/no, or true/false situation.


### 2. Reference Data Types
Reference data types are used to store complex data structures. Instead of holding actual data, they store the address (or reference) to the memory location where the data is stored.

#### a) String
- **What is it?** A sequence of characters, like words or sentences.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  String name = "John Doe";
- Use: Used for text (e.g., names, addresses, or any words).

#### b) Arrays
- **What is it?** A list of values of the same type.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
- Use: Used to store multiple values in a single variable. For example, you could store multiple numbers in an array.

#### c) Objects
- **What is it?** A collection of data and functions that belong to a specific entity or class.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Car myCar = new Car();
- Use: Used for creating and storing complex data structures. Objects are the backbone of object-oriented programming (OOP), where you create entities like Car, Person, or Book.

-----
### Why Are Data Types Important?

- **Memory Management:** Different data types take up different amounts of memory. For example, a `byte` takes only 1 byte, but an `int` takes 4 bytes. Choosing the right data type can save memory.
- **Type Safety:** Data types prevent mistakes. For example, you can’t accidentally store text (`String`) in a variable meant to hold numbers (`int`). It helps keep your program from errors and bugs.
- **Performance:** Using the correct data type helps your program run faster and use resources (like memory) efficiently. For example, using `byte` instead of `int` for small numbers can improve performance.

### Real-Life Example:
Imagine you are setting up a bank account system where you need to store the following details:

- **The name of the account holder:** Use `String`
- **The account balance:** Use `double` (because it has decimal places)
- **The account number:** Use `int` (whole number)
- **Whether the account is active or not:** Use `boolean` (true or false)

Here’s how you might write it:
```java
public class BankAccount {
    String accountHolder = "John Doe";  // String for text
    double balance = 5000.75;  // double for decimal values
    int accountNumber = 123456789;  // int for whole numbers
    boolean isActive = true;  // boolean for true/false
}
```
This simple example shows how different types of data are stored and used in the real world!

### Summary:
- **Primitive Data Types** store basic values like numbers, characters, and true/false values.
- **Reference Data Types** store more complex data like text, arrays, and objects.
- **Data types** help us save memory, prevent errors, and make our programs run efficiently.
- By understanding data types, we can write better and more efficient code!

# Operators and Expressions in Java

## What Are Operators?

In programming, **operators** are symbols or words that perform operations on variables and values. They are used to manipulate data and variables in your program. Think of them as tools that help you do calculations, compare values, or even change the values of variables.

---

## Types of Operators in Java

Java has several types of operators that you will frequently use. Here’s an easy-to-understand breakdown:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

These are the most basic operators that deal with mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two values together.

```java
int sum = 10 + 5;  // sum = 15
```
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one value from another.
```java
int sub = 10 - 5;  // sub = 5
```
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two values.
```java
int mult = 10 * 5;  // mult = 50
```
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides one value by another.
```java
int div = 10 / 5;  // div = 2
```
- **Modulus (`%`)**: Gives the remainder of a division.
```java
int rem = 10 % 3;  // rem = 1
```


### 2. Relational (Comparison) Operators

These operators compare two values and return a boolean result (`true` or `false`).

- **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two values are the same.

```java
boolean result = 5 == 5;  // result will be true
```
- **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are different.
```java
boolean result = 5 != 3;
```
- **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if one value is greater than the other.
```java
boolean result = 5 > 3;  // result will be true
```
- **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if one value is less than the other.
```java
boolean result = 5 < 10;  // result will be true
```
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if one value is greater than or equal to the other.
```java
boolean result = 5 >= 5;  // result will be true
```
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if one value is less than or equal to the other.
```java
boolean result = 3 <= 4;  // result will be true
```
### 3. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a `true` or `false` result.

- **AND (`&&`)**: Returns `true` if both conditions are true.

```java
boolean result = (5 > 3) && (10 > 5);  // result will be true because both conditions are true
```
- **OR (`||`)**: Returns true if at least one condition is true.
```java
boolean result = (5 < 3) || (10 > 5);  // result will be true
```
- **NOT (`!`)**: Reverses the boolean value. If it’s true, it becomes false, and if it’s false, it becomes true.
```java
boolean result = !(5 < 3);  // result will be true because 5 is not less than 3
```

### 4. Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- **Equal (`=`)**: Assigns a value to a variable.

```java
int x = 5;  // Assigns the value 5 to the variable x
```
- **Add and assign (`+=`)**: Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result back to the variable.
```java
x += 3;  // Equivalent to x = x + 3; Now x will be 8
```
- **Subtract and assign (`-=`)**: Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result back.
```java
x -= 2;  // Equivalent to x = x - 2; Now x will be 6
```
- **Multiply and assign (`*=`)**: Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result back.
```java
x *= 2;  // Equivalent to x = x * 2; Now x will be 12
```
- **Divide and assign (`/=`)**: Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result back.
```java
x /= 3;  // Equivalent to x = x / 3; Now x will be 4
```

### 5. Unary Operators

Unary operators operate on a single variable.

- **Increment (`++`)**: Increases the value of a variable by 1.

```java
int x = 5;
x++;  // x is now 6
```
- **Decrement (`--`)**: Decreases the value of a variable by 1.
```java
int count = 5;
count--;  // count will be 4
```
### 6. Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shortcut for `if-else` statements. It allows you to write a simple condition check in one line, with three parts: 

- A **condition**
- A **result if the condition is true**
- A **result if the condition is false**

The syntax is:

```java
int age = 20;
String result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";  // result will be "Adult"

```
### What Are Expressions?

An expression is a combination of variables, constants, operators, and functions that are evaluated to produce a value. Expressions are used in Java to perform operations within statements, such as performing calculations or making comparisons.

In simple terms, an expression is something that the program evaluates to give you a result.

#### Examples of Expressions:

1. **Simple Arithmetic Expression:**

```java
int sum = 5 + 3;  // The expression 5 + 3 is evaluated, and the result (8) is assigned to the variable sum
```

2. **Relational Expression:**
```java
boolean isGreater = (5 > 3);  // isGreater will be true
```

3. **Logical Expression:**
```java
boolean result = (5 > 3) && (10 < 20);  // result will be true
```
4. **Ternary Expression:**
```java
String message = (10 > 5) ? "Greater" : "Smaller";  // message will be "Greater"
```

### How Do Operators and Expressions Work Together?

Operators and expressions work hand-in-hand to perform operations and return results. Operators modify the data, while expressions group the operators and values together to form a complete operation.

In Java, an **expression** can consist of values, variables, operators, and function calls. The **operators** act on the values and variables within the expression to calculate the final result.

#### Example:

```java
int x = (5 + 3) * 2;
```
- Here, (5 + 3) is an expression that evaluates to 8, and 8 * 2 is another expression that evaluates to 16. The final result is assigned to the variable x.

### Why Are Operators and Expressions Important?

1. **Mathematical Calculations**: Operators help you perform mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They allow you to manipulate numerical data in your programs.

2. **Making Decisions**: Logical and relational operators are used to compare values and make decisions in your program. For example, you can check if a condition is true or false, which helps control the flow of your program (e.g., using `if` statements).

3. **Efficient Code**: Understanding how operators and expressions work allows you to write more efficient, readable, and concise code. With the right operators and well-formed expressions, you can avoid redundancy and make your code easier to understand and maintain.

### Real-Life Example of Operators and Expressions:

Let’s say you're creating a simple program to check if someone qualifies for a discount at a store based on their age and the total amount of their purchase.

```java
int age = 25;
double purchaseAmount = 150.0;

boolean qualifiesForDiscount = (age >= 18) && (purchaseAmount > 100);
System.out.println("Qualifies for discount: " + qualifiesForDiscount);
```

- The relational operator >= checks if the age is 18 or older.
- The relational operator > checks if the purchase amount is greater than 100.
- The logical operator && ensures that both conditions must be true for the discount to apply

# Control Statements (if, switch, loops) in Java

## 1. `if` Statement
The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is `true`. If the condition is `false`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.

### Syntax:
```java
if (condition) {
  // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

### Scenario:
A student needs to check whether they have passed or failed based on their marks.

### Examples:

1. **Check if a student passes**
   ```java
   int marks = 80;
   if (marks >= 50) {
     System.out.println("Student has passed.");
   }
   ```

2. **Check if a number is positive**
   ```java
   int number = 5;
   if (number > 0) {
     System.out.println("The number is positive.");
   }
   ```

3. **Check if a number is even**
   ```java
   int num = 4;
   if (num % 2 == 0) {
     System.out.println("The number is even.");
   }
   ```

4. **Check age for voting eligibility**
   ```java
   int age = 18;
   if (age >= 18) {
     System.out.println("Eligible to vote.");
   }
   ```

5. **Check if a temperature is below freezing**
   ```java
   int temperature = -5;
   if (temperature < 0) {
     System.out.println("The weather is freezing.");
   }
   ```

## 2. `else` Statement
The `else` statement runs a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is `false`.

### Syntax:
```java
if (condition) {
  // code if condition is true
} else {
  // code if condition is false
}
```

### Scenario:
A student is checking if they can enter a contest based on their age.

### Examples:

1. **Check if a student passes or fails**
   ```java
   int marks = 40;
   if (marks >= 50) {
     System.out.println("Student has passed.");
   } else {
     System.out.println("Student has failed.");
   }
   ```

2. **Check if a number is positive or negative**
   ```java
   int number = -3;
   if (number > 0) {
     System.out.println("The number is positive.");
   } else {
     System.out.println("The number is negative.");
   }
   ```

3. **Check if it's daytime or nighttime**
   ```java
   int time = 10;  // 10 AM
   if (time < 12) {
     System.out.println("Good Morning!");
   } else {
     System.out.println("Good Evening!");
   }
   ```

4. **Check if a person is eligible for a discount**
   ```java
   int age = 15;
   if (age >= 18) {
     System.out.println("Eligible for a discount.");
   } else {
     System.out.println("Not eligible for a discount.");
   }
   ```

5. **Check if it's freezing or not**
   ```java
   int temperature = 10;
   if (temperature < 0) {
     System.out.println("It's freezing.");
   } else {
     System.out.println("It's not freezing.");
   }
   ```

## 3. `else if` Statement
The `else if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions. It’s used when you need to test more than one condition in a sequence.

### Syntax:
```java
if (condition1) {
  // code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code if condition2 is true
} else {
  // code if none of the conditions are true
}
```

### Scenario:
A person is checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Examples:

1. **Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero**
   ```java
   int number = 0;
   if (number > 0) {
     System.out.println("The number is positive.");
   } else if (number < 0) {
     System.out.println("The number is negative.");
   } else {
     System.out.println("The number is zero.");
   }
   ```

2. **Check if a student is grade A, B, or C**
   ```java
   int marks = 75;
   if (marks >= 85) {
     System.out.println("Grade A");
   } else if (marks >= 65) {
     System.out.println("Grade B");
   } else {
     System.out.println("Grade C");
   }
   ```

3. **Check if it's morning, afternoon, or night**
   ```java
   int hour = 14; // 2 PM
   if (hour < 12) {
     System.out.println("Good morning!");
   } else if (hour < 18) {
     System.out.println("Good afternoon!");
   } else {
     System.out.println("Good evening!");
   }
   ```

4. **Check if it's a weekend or weekday**
   ```java
   String day = "Monday";
   if (day.equals("Saturday") || day.equals("Sunday")) {
     System.out.println("It's a weekend.");
   } else {
     System.out.println("It's a weekday.");
   }
   ```

5. **Check age group**
   ```java
   int age = 25;
   if (age < 13) {
     System.out.println("Child");
   } else if (age < 20) {
     System.out.println("Teenager");
   } else {
     System.out.println("Adult");
   }
   ```

## 4. `switch` Statement
The `switch` statement is used to evaluate a single expression and match it against multiple cases. It is often more readable than multiple `if`/`else if` statements when there are many conditions.

### Syntax:
```java
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to run if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to run if expression matches value2
    break;
  default:
    // code to run if no cases match
}
```

### Scenario:
A person is checking the day of the week to print a message.

### Examples:

1. **Check day of the week**
   ```java
   String day = "Monday";
   switch (day) {
     case "Monday":
       System.out.println("Start of the week!");
       break;
     case "Friday":
       System.out.println("Weekend is near!");
       break;
     default:
       System.out.println("Midweek!");
   }
   ```

2. **Check vehicle type**
   ```java
   String vehicle = "car";
   switch (vehicle) {
     case "car":
       System.out.println("Four wheels");
       break;
     case "bike":
       System.out.println("Two wheels");
       break;
     default:
       System.out.println("Unknown vehicle");
   }
   ```

3. **Check grade**
   ```java
   String grade = "A";
   switch (grade) {
     case "A":
       System.out.println("Excellent!");
       break;
     case "B":
       System.out.println("Good!");
       break;
     case "C":
       System.out.println("Fair");
       break;
     default:
       System.out.println("Failed");
   }
   ```

4. **Check fruit color**
   ```java
   String fruit = "apple";
   switch (fruit) {
     case "apple":
       System.out.println("Red or green");
       break;
     case "banana":
       System.out.println("Yellow");
       break;
     default:
       System.out.println("Unknown fruit");
   }
   ```

5. **Check month**

       break;
     case "March":
     case "April":
     case "May":
       System.out.println("Spring");
       break;
     default:
       System.out.println("Summer or Fall");
   }
   ```

# Loops in Java: Detailed Explanation for Students

## What is a Loop?
A **loop** is a way to make the computer repeat a set of instructions. For example, if you want to print "Hello!" 5 times, instead of writing it 5 times in the code, you can use a loop to do it for you.
It saves time and makes your code shorter and smarter.

## Types of Loops in Java
1. **`for` loop**: Use this when you know how many times the loop should run.
2. **`while` loop**: Use this when you don’t know how many times it will run, but you know the condition it should stop at.
3. **`do-while` loop**: Like `while`, but this one will always run at least once before checking the condition.

---

## How a Loop Works

Think of a loop like a washing machine:
1. You start the machine (initialization).
2. The machine checks if the clothes are still dirty (condition).
3. If dirty, it washes (executes the code).
4. After washing, it checks again (updates).
5. It keeps repeating until the clothes are clean (condition is false).

---

## 1. `for` Loop
The `for` loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat something.

### Syntax:
```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

### How it Works (Simple Explanation):
1. **Initialization**: Start with a variable, like `int i = 0`. It tells the loop where to begin.
2. **Condition**: This decides how long the loop will run. For example, `i < 5` means, "Keep running while `i` is less than 5."
3. **Update**: After each round, update the variable. For example, `i++` adds 1 to `i`.

---

### Example:
Let’s print numbers from 1 to 5 using a `for` loop:

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

### What Happens in This Code:
- **Step 1**: Start with `i = 1`.
- **Step 2**: Check the condition: Is `i <= 5`? (Yes, so run the code.)
- **Step 3**: Print `i` (1).
- **Step 4**: Add 1 to `i` (now `i = 2`) and repeat steps 2–4 until `i > 5`.

### Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

---
# `while` and `do-while` Loops in Java

In Java, both `while` and `do-while` loops are used for repeating a block of code multiple times, but they have key differences in how they check the condition and when the loop executes.

---

### 1. `while` Loop

The **`while` loop** repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true. It checks the condition **before** running the loop's body, so if the condition is false initially, the code inside the loop will **never execute**.

#### Syntax:

```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
}
```
- condition: An expression that evaluates to true or false. If true, the loop executes; if false, the loop stops.
- The loop continues executing as long as the condition remains true.

```
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;  // Increment the counter
}
```
- What Happens in This Code:
- Step 1: Start with i = 1.
- Step 2: Check the condition i <= 5. Since it's true, enter the loop.
- Step 3: Print i (1).
- Step 4: Increment i (now i = 2).
- Step 5: Check the condition again. If it's true, repeat steps 3–5. If it's false, exit the loop.

- Key Point:
Condition checked before execution: If the condition is false initially, the loop does not run at all.
----
## 3. `do-while` Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but with one important difference: it checks the condition **after** executing the loop's body. This means the block of code inside the loop will always run at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

### Syntax:

```java
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```
- condition: Like in the while loop, this determines whether the loop will continue running. However, it's checked after the loop body executes, so the loop will run at least once regardless of the condition.

```
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;  // Increment the counter
} while (i <= 5);

````
**What Happens in This Code:**
- Step 1: Start with i = 1.
- Step 2: The block of code inside the loop is executed once, printing i (1).
- Step 3: Increment i (now i = 2).
- Step 4: Check the condition i <= 5. Since it's true, repeat the loop.
- Step 5: After the condition is checked, if it's still true, the loop continues.

- Key Point:
Condition checked after execution: The loop runs at least once, even if the condition is false initially.
----

## Differences Between Loops

| Feature        | `for` Loop               | `while` Loop          | `do-while` Loop         |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Use Case       | When you know how many times it should run. | When you don’t know how many times it will run. | When you want it to run at least once. |
| Condition Check | Before running the block. | Before running the block. | After running the block. |
| Runs at Least Once? | No                       | No                     | Yes                     |

---

## Key Points to Remember
1. **Infinite Loops**: If the condition never becomes false, the loop will run forever. For example:
   ```java
   while (true) {
       System.out.println("This never stops!");
   }
   ```
   Use **`break`** to stop an infinite loop when needed.

2. **Skipping Iterations (`continue`)**: Use `continue` to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move to the next one.
   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
       if (i == 3) continue;
       System.out.println(i);
   }
   // Output: 1 2 4 5
   ```

3. **Exiting Loops (`break`)**: Use `break` to stop the loop immediately.
   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
       if (i == 3) break;
       System.out.println(i);
   }
   // Output: 1 2
   ```

---

## Real-Life Analogy
Imagine you’re climbing stairs:
- **`for` loop**: You know there are 10 stairs, so you take 10 steps and stop.
- **`while` loop**: You don’t know how many stairs there are, so you keep going until you see no more stairs.
- **`do-while` loop**: You take one step first, then check if there are more stairs.

---

### **1. `for` Loop**
The `for` loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat something.

   }
   ```

### **`while` Loop**
The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.

### Syntax:
```java
while (condition) {
  // code to execute as long as condition is true
}
```

### Scenario:
A person needs to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop.

   ```java
   int i = 1;
   while (i <= 10) {
     System.out.println(7 * i);
     i++;
   }
   ```

4. **Sum of numbers from 1 to 5**
   ```java
   int sum = 0;
   int i = 1;
   while (i <= 5) {
     sum += i;
     i++;
   }
   System.out.println(sum);
   ```

5. **Print characters in a string using `while` loop**
   ```java
   String name = "Alice";
   int i = 0;
   while (i < name.length()) {
     System.out.println(name.charAt(i));
     i++;
   }
   ```

### **`do...while` Loop**
The `do...while` loop executes a block of code at least once, and then repeats the execution as long as the condition is true.

### Syntax:
```java
do {
  // code to execute
} while (condition);
```

### Scenario:
A student is trying to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a `do...while` loop.

### Examples:

1. **Print numbers from 1 to 5**
   ```java
   int i = 1;
   do {
     System.out.println(i);
     i++;
   } while (i <= 5);
   ```

2. **Print even numbers from 0 to 10**
   ```java
   int i = 0;
   do {
     System.out.println(i);
     i += 2;
   } while (i <= 10);
   ```

3. **Print multiplication table of 3**
   ```java
   int i = 1;
   do {
     System.out.println(3 * i);
     i++;
   } while (i <= 10);
   ```

4. **Sum of numbers from 1 to 5**
   ```java
   int sum = 0;
   int i = 1;
   do {
     sum += i;
     i++;
   } while (i <= 5);
   System.out.println(sum);
   ```

5. **Print characters in a string using `do...while` loop**
   ```java
   String name = "Bob";
   int i = 0;
   do {
     System.out.println(name.charAt(i));
     i++;
   } while (i < name.length());
   ```

## Conclusion
Control statements (if, switch, loops) are fundamental in Java to control the flow of execution based on conditions or repeated actions. Understanding when and how to use them is crucial for writing efficient and readable code.

### Practice Exercise
1. Create a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a program using `switch` to print the name of a month based on its number (1-12).
3. Implement a program using loops that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

# Methods (Functions) in Java

A **method** in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is one of the most fundamental concepts in programming and helps organize your code into reusable pieces.

---

## Why Use Methods?
- **Reusability**: Write once, use many times.
- **Modularity**: Break the program into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Readability**: Makes the code easier to read and understand.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and modify the code.

---

## Method Structure
A method in Java consists of:
1. **Access Modifier**: Defines the visibility of the method (e.g., `public`, `private`).
2. **Return Type**: Specifies the type of value the method returns (e.g., `int`, `void`).
3. **Method Name**: Describes what the method does (e.g., `calculateSum`).
4. **Parameters**: Inputs the method can take, written inside parentheses.
5. **Method Body**: The code that defines what the method does, enclosed in `{}`.

### Syntax:
```java
accessModifier returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // Method body (code to execute)
    return value; // Optional, depending on return type
}
```

---

## Simple Example
Let’s start with a simple example:

### Code:
```java
class HelloWorld {
    // Method to print a message
    public void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HelloWorld hw = new HelloWorld(); // Create an object
        hw.printMessage(); // Call the method
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Hello, World!
```

---

## Types of Methods

### 1. **Void Methods**
Void methods perform an action but do not return any value.

#### Example:
```java
class Greeting {
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greeting g = new Greeting();
        g.sayHello();
    }
}
```

#### Output:
```
Hello!
```

### 2. **Methods with Return Values**
These methods perform a task and return a value to the caller.

#### Example:
```java
class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // Return the sum
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        int result = calc.add(5, 10); // Store the returned value
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}
```

#### Output:
```
Sum: 15
```

### 3. **Parameterized Methods**
These methods accept inputs (parameters) and use them to perform their tasks.

#### Example:
```java
class Greetings {
    public void greet(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greetings g = new Greetings();
        g.greet("Alice");
        g.greet("Bob");
    }
}
```

#### Output:
```
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
```

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Method Overloading**
Having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

#### Example:
```java
class MathOperations {
    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    public double multiply(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperations math = new MathOperations();
        System.out.println(math.multiply(5, 10));       // Calls the int version
        System.out.println(math.multiply(5.5, 10.5));   // Calls the double version
    }
}
```

#### Output:
```
50
57.75
```

### 2. **Static Methods**
Static methods belong to the class rather than an instance of the class. They can be called without creating an object.

#### Example:
```java
class Utility {
    public static int square(int number) {
        return number * number;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = Utility.square(4); // No need to create an object
        System.out.println("Square: " + result);
    }
}
```

#### Output:
```
Square: 16
```

### 3. **Method Scope**
Variables declared inside a method are local to that method and cannot be accessed outside of it.

#### Example:
```java
class ScopeExample {
    public void showScope() {
        int localVariable = 10; // Local variable
        System.out.println("Local variable: " + localVariable);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScopeExample scope = new ScopeExample();
        scope.showScope();
        // System.out.println(localVariable); // Error: Cannot access localVariable here
    }
}
```

---

## Best Practices for Methods
1. **Use meaningful names**: Names should describe what the method does (e.g., `calculateSum`).
2. **Keep methods short**: A method should perform one task.
3. **Document methods**: Use comments or JavaDoc to explain what the method does.
4. **Avoid too many parameters**: If a method requires too many inputs, consider breaking it into smaller methods.

---

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a way to organize code by grouping related **data** (properties) and **behaviors** (methods) into objects.

---

## 🎯 Why OOP?
- Keeps code **organized** and **easy to manage**.
- Allows **reusing** code instead of writing the same thing over and over.
- Makes it easier to **update** or **extend** functionality.

---

## 🐾 Real-World Example: A Zoo
Imagine a zoo where each animal is an **object**.

### Example: A Lion
- **Properties** (data):
  - `name: Simba`
  - `species: Lion`
  - `color: Golden`
- **Methods** (actions):
  - `roar()`
  - `hunt()`

### Example: A Bird
- **Properties**:
  - `name: Tweety`
  - `species: Bird`
  - `color: Yellow`
- **Methods**:
  - `fly()`
  - `sing()`

---

## 🏗 Key Concepts in OOP

### 1. **Class**
A **blueprint** for creating objects. Think of it as a recipe.

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name, species) {
    this.name = name;       // Property
    this.species = species; // Property
  }

  speak() {                 // Method
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}
```

---

### 2. **Object**
An **instance** of a class. Think of it as a specific animal created from the recipe.

```javascript
const lion = new Animal('Simba', 'Lion'); // Object
lion.speak(); // Output: "Simba makes a sound."
```

---

### 3. **Inheritance**
A way to **reuse code** by creating a new class from an existing one.

```javascript
class Bird extends Animal {
  fly() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is flying!`);
  }
}

const tweety = new Bird('Tweety', 'Bird');
tweety.fly(); // Output: "Tweety is flying!"
```

---

### 4. **Encapsulation**
Keeping the details **hidden** and only exposing what’s necessary.

```javascript
class BankAccount {
  #balance; // Private property
  constructor(balance) {
    this.#balance = balance;
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount(1000);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // Output: 1000
```

---

## 🌟 Benefits of OOP
- **Readable**: Code is easier to understand.
- **Reusable**: Avoids duplication with inheritance.
- **Maintainable**: Makes updates easier by grouping related stuff.

---

## 🎉 Summary
OOP is like organizing your desk. Instead of having everything scattered, you group related things together into neat objects. This helps make your code clean, reusable, and efficient.

---

## 1. **Encapsulation**

### Definition:
Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. It hides the internal implementation details and exposes only what is necessary.

### Real-World Example:
A **bank account** allows users to deposit or withdraw money but restricts direct access to the account balance.

### Benefits:
- Protects the internal state of an object.
- Provides controlled access to data.
- Enhances security and maintainability.

### Code Example:
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Encapsulated variable

    // Constructor to initialize balance
    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        if (initialBalance >= 0) {
            this.balance = initialBalance;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Initial balance cannot be negative!");
            this.balance = 0;
        }
    }

    // Public method to deposit money
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Deposit amount must be positive!");
        }
    }

    // Public method to withdraw money
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrew: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds or invalid amount!");
        }
    }

    // Public getter method to view balance
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000);
        account.deposit(500);
        account.withdraw(300);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Deposited: 500
Withdrew: 300
Balance: 1200
```

---

## 2. **Inheritance**

### Definition:
Inheritance allows one class (child) to acquire the properties and methods of another class (parent). This promotes **code reuse** and hierarchy.

### Real-World Example:
A **Car** class has general properties like speed, color, and methods like drive. A **SportsCar** inherits from the Car class and adds unique features like turbo mode.

### Benefits:
- Reduces code duplication.
- Simplifies extension and maintenance.
- Promotes hierarchical design.

### Code Example:
```java
// Parent class
class Car {
    private String brand;
    private int speed;

    public Car(String brand, int speed) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.speed = speed;
    }

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is driving at " + speed + " km/h.");
    }
}

// Child class
class SportsCar extends Car {
    private boolean turboEnabled;

    public SportsCar(String brand, int speed) {
        super(brand, speed); // Call parent class constructor
        this.turboEnabled = false;
    }

    public void enableTurbo() {
        this.turboEnabled = true;
        System.out.println("Turbo mode activated!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SportsCar myCar = new SportsCar("Ferrari", 200);
        myCar.drive();       // Inherited method
        myCar.enableTurbo(); // Specific to SportsCar
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Ferrari is driving at 200 km/h.
Turbo mode activated!
```

---

## 3. **Polymorphism**

### Definition:
Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows a single method, object, or interface to behave differently based on the context.

### Real-World Example:
A **remote control** can control different devices (TV, AC, etc.), but the behavior of the buttons changes depending on the device.

### Types:
1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**: Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
2. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**: A method in a child class overrides a method in the parent class.

### Code Examples:
#### Compile-Time Polymorphism:
```java
class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println("Integer Sum: " + calc.add(5, 10));
        System.out.println("Double Sum: " + calc.add(5.5, 10.5));
    }
}
```

#### Run-Time Polymorphism:
```java
class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal;

        myAnimal = new Dog(); // Polymorphism
        myAnimal.sound();

        myAnimal = new Cat(); // Polymorphism
        myAnimal.sound();
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Dog barks.
Cat meows.
```

---

## 4. **Abstraction**

### Definition:
Abstraction hides the implementation details of a system and only shows the essential features to the user. It can be achieved using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**.

### Real-World Example:
When you drive a car, you don’t worry about how the engine works. You only use the steering, accelerator, and brake.

### Benefits:
- Simplifies the system for the user.
- Promotes focus on what an object **does** rather than how it **works**.

### Code Example:
#### Using Abstract Classes:
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw(); // Abstract method

    public void info() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle...");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Rectangle...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape;

        shape = new Circle();
        shape.draw();

        shape = new Rectangle();
        shape.draw();
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Drawing a Circle...
Drawing a Rectangle...
```

# Java Collections Framework Roadmap  

## 1. What are Collections and Why Do We Need Them?  
Collections are tools in Java to store and manage groups of objects, like a list of names or a set of unique numbers.  

**Why Collections are Better than Arrays:**  
- They can grow or shrink in size automatically.  
- They provide ready-made methods for common tasks like sorting, searching, etc.  

---

## 2. Important Interfaces (Blueprints) in Collections  
Java Collections are built around these key interfaces (think of them as blueprints for storing data):  

### **List**  
- For ordered data where duplicates are allowed (e.g., a list of names).  
- **Example Classes:** `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`  

### **Set**  
- For storing unique items (e.g., unique IDs).  
- **Example Classes:** `HashSet`, `TreeSet`  

### **Queue**  
- For storing items in the order they need to be processed (e.g., a line of customers).  
- **Example Classes:** `PriorityQueue`, `ArrayDeque`  

### **Map**  
- For storing key-value pairs (e.g., a phone book where each name has a number).  
- **Example Classes:** `HashMap`, `TreeMap`  

---

## 3. Basic Data Structures and Their Use  
# Key Collection Types in Java

## 1. **List**
A **List** is an ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. It is ideal for scenarios where the order of items is important, like a to-do list.

### Examples:
- **ArrayList**:
  - **Best for Fast Searching and Random Access**  
  If you need to quickly find or access an item by its position in the list (like getting the 3rd item), an **ArrayList** is very efficient. This is because it uses an array internally, where each item has an index.

- **Backed by a Dynamic Array**  
  An **ArrayList** is built on top of a dynamic array. Unlike regular arrays, it can grow or shrink in size automatically. If you add more items than it can currently hold, it will create a larger array to accommodate all the items.

- **Slower for Inserting/Removing Items in the Middle**  
  When you add or remove an item in the middle of the list, all the items after that position need to be shifted to make space or fill the gap. This shifting process takes extra time, making these operations slower compared to structures like a LinkedList.
  - Example:
    ```java
    List<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
    arrayList.add("Task 1");
    arrayList.add("Task 2");
    System.out.println(arrayList); // Output: [Task 1, Task 2]
    ```
- **LinkedList**:
 - **Efficient for Inserting/Removing Items in the Middle of the List**  
  A **LinkedList** is great when you frequently add or remove items from the middle of the list. Unlike an **ArrayList**, it doesn't need to shift items around because it's made up of nodes that are linked together.

- **Backed by a Doubly-Linked List**  
  A **LinkedList** uses a data structure called a doubly-linked list. Each item (node) in the list contains data and two links: one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next. This structure makes it easy to add or remove nodes.

- **Slower for Searching Because It Requires Traversal**  
  To find an item in a **LinkedList**, you have to start from the beginning (or end) and move through each node one by one until you find what you're looking for. This process takes more time compared to an **ArrayList**, which can directly access items by their position.
  - Example:
    ```java
    List<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();
    linkedList.add("Node 1");
    linkedList.add("Node 2");
    System.out.println(linkedList); // Output: [Node 1, Node 2]
    ```

---

## 2. **Set**
- **Ensures All Elements Are Unique**  
  A **Set** is a collection where duplicate elements are not allowed. It automatically ensures that every item in the collection is unique, making it perfect for cases where repetition is not allowed, such as storing student IDs or unique inventory items.

- **When to Use**  
  Use a **Set** when you want to keep only unique elements and don’t care about the order in which they are stored.

- **Examples of Set Implementations**  
  - **HashSet**:  
    - Best for fast operations like adding, removing, or checking if an item exists.  
    - Does not maintain any order of elements.
  - **TreeSet**:  
    - Keeps elements in sorted order.  
    - Slightly slower than **HashSet** due to the sorting overhead.
  - **LinkedHashSet**:  
    - Maintains the insertion order of elements.  
    - Useful when you need unique elements and want to preserve their order of addition.

### Examples:
- **HashSet**:
  - Offers fast operations (add, remove, search) with no guaranteed order.
  - Backed by a hash table.
  - Example:
    ```java
    Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
    hashSet.add("ID1");
    hashSet.add("ID2");
    hashSet.add("ID1"); // Duplicate, will not be added.
    System.out.println(hashSet); // Output: [ID1, ID2]
    ```
- **TreeSet**:
  - Keeps elements sorted in natural order or by a custom comparator.
  - Slower than HashSet but useful when sorted data is required.
  - Example:
    ```java
    Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
    treeSet.add("Banana");
    treeSet.add("Apple");
    System.out.println(treeSet); // Output: [Apple, Banana]
    ```

---

## 3. **Queue**
- **Represents a Waiting Line (FIFO - First In, First Out)**  
  A **Queue** is a collection where elements are processed in the order they were added, just like a line of people waiting for service. The first person to enter the line is the first to be served (FIFO).

- **When to Use**  
  Use a **Queue** when you need to process items in the order they were added, such as handling tasks in a task manager, processing customer requests, or managing data streams.

- **Examples of Queue Implementations**  
  - **PriorityQueue**:  
    - Items are processed based on priority rather than the order they were added.  
    - The highest priority item is processed first, making it useful for scheduling tasks or handling events in a system.
  - **LinkedList** (Used as a Queue):  
    - A **LinkedList** can be used as a **Queue** where elements are added at the end and removed from the front.  
    - It's efficient for adding and removing items from both ends of the list.
  - **ArrayDeque**:  
    - A **Deque** (Double-Ended Queue) can function as a regular **Queue** and allows adding and removing elements from both ends of the collection, making it a flexible option.

### Examples:
- **PriorityQueue**:
  - Automatically prioritizes items based on natural order or a comparator.
  - Example:
    ```java
    Queue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();
    priorityQueue.add(5);
    priorityQueue.add(1);
    priorityQueue.add(3);
    System.out.println(priorityQueue); // Output: [1, 5, 3] (priority-based)
    System.out.println(priorityQueue.poll()); // Output: 1 (removes highest priority)
    ```

---

## 4. **Map**
- **Stores Key-Value Pairs**  
  A **Map** is a collection that stores data in the form of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a specific value, meaning that you can retrieve the value by referencing the key. It's like a dictionary where each word (key) maps to its definition (value).

- **When to Use**  
  Use a **Map** when you need to store data where each piece of information has a unique identifier (key), and you want to quickly look up, update, or remove data using the key. Common use cases include creating a phone book (name to phone number mapping) or an address book (email to contact info).

- **Examples of Map Implementations**  
  - **HashMap**:  
    - Best for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.  
    - Does not maintain the order of elements.
  - **TreeMap**:  
    - Keeps the keys in sorted order.  
    - Slower than **HashMap** due to sorting overhead, but useful when you need ordered keys.
  - **LinkedHashMap**:  
    - Maintains the order of elements based on the order they were added.  
    - Useful when you want to store key-value pairs and maintain insertion order.






### Examples:
- **HashMap**:
  - Fast for lookups and insertions.
  - Does not guarantee order of elements.
  - Example:
    ```java
    Map<String, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
    hashMap.put("Alice", "12345");
    hashMap.put("Bob", "67890");
    System.out.println(hashMap); // Output: {Alice=12345, Bob=67890}
    ```
- **TreeMap**:
  - Keeps keys sorted in natural order or by a custom comparator.
  - Slower than HashMap but useful when sorted data is required.
  - Example:
    ```java
    Map<String, String> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();
    treeMap.put("Charlie", "54321");
    treeMap.put("Alice", "12345");
    System.out.println(treeMap); // Output: {Alice=12345, Charlie=54321}
    ```

## 4. Learn Basic Operations  
Practice common operations for each collection type:  

- **List:** Add, remove, and search for items.  
- **Set:** Add unique items.  
- **Queue:** Add items and process them in order.  
- **Map:** Store and retrieve key-value pairs.  

---

## 5. Make Your Collections Smart with Sorting  
- Use **`Comparable`** for natural ordering (e.g., A-Z).  
- Use **`Comparator`** for custom sorting (e.g., sort students by age).  

---

## 6. Be Safe with Thread-Safe Collections  
If multiple users are accessing your collections (like in an online app), use thread-safe collections:  

- Use `ConcurrentHashMap` instead of `HashMap`.  
- Use `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for thread-safe lists.  

---

## 7. Generics – A Fancy Word for Type Safety  
Collections use generics to ensure all items are of the same type.  

### **Example:**  
```java
List<String> words = new ArrayList<>();
words.add("Hello");
// words.add(123); // This will cause a compile-time error
```
# Mastering Java Collections

## 8. Handle Advanced Scenarios

### Set Operations
Combine or compare sets to handle scenarios like finding common or unique items in two sets.

### Map Tricks
Work with complex data by storing maps of lists or other intricate structures.

### Thread-Safe Apps
When working with threads (programs doing multiple things at once), use special thread-safe collections.

---

## 9. Learn New Features in Modern Java (Java 8+)

### Streams API
Process collections in a simple and modern way using the Streams API.

#### Example: Filter out numbers greater than 10
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 15, 20, 25);
List<Integer> filtered = numbers.stream()
                                .filter(num -> num > 10)
                                .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(filtered); // Output: [15, 20, 25]
```
## Lambda Functions
Write concise and clean code to iterate through collections effortlessly.

### Example:
```java
list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
```

Use **Collectors** to gather and transform data from streams into collections like **lists**, **sets**, or **maps**.

### Example:
Convert a stream of names into a **Set**:
```java
Set<String> nameSet = names.stream()
                           .filter(name -> name.length() > 3)
                           .collect(Collectors.toSet());
```

# Java Collections Framework: Lists, Sets, and Maps

## Why Use Collections in Java?
Imagine you are organizing a library with hundreds of books. You want to:
- Keep track of all the books.
- Avoid duplicate entries for the same book.
- Quickly find a book by its title or ISBN.

Handling such tasks using arrays can be tedious and inefficient. The Java Collections Framework provides **Lists**, **Sets**, and **Maps**, which make handling such data much easier, efficient, and flexible.

---

## **1. Lists**
A **List** is an ordered collection of elements. It allows duplicate entries and maintains the order in which elements are inserted.

### **Scenario**
You want to store the names of students in the order they registered for a course.

### **Key Features**
- **Duplicates Allowed:** You can add the same name twice.
- **Indexed Access:** Each student has an index (position).

### **Example**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> students = new ArrayList<>();

        // Adding students
        students.add("Alice");
        students.add("Bob");
        students.add("Alice");

        // Printing students
        System.out.println("Registered Students: " + students);

        // Accessing by index
        System.out.println("First student: " + students.get(0));
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run**
| Operation               | List Content        |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| `students.add("Alice")` | ["Alice"]           |
| `students.add("Bob")`   | ["Alice", "Bob"]    |
| `students.add("Alice")` | ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice"] |
| `students.get(0)`       | Outputs: "Alice"    |

---

## **2. Sets**
A **Set** is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements. It is useful when you want to ensure unique entries.

### **Scenario**
You are managing an online voting system where each voter can vote only once.

### **Key Features**
- **No Duplicates:** Ensures that each voter can vote only once.
- **Unordered:** Does not maintain the insertion order.

### **Example**
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class SetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> voters = new HashSet<>();

        // Adding voters
        voters.add("Alice");
        voters.add("Bob");
        voters.add("Alice");

        // Printing voters
        System.out.println("Unique Voters: " + voters);
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run**
| Operation               | Set Content         |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| `voters.add("Alice")`   | ["Alice"]           |
| `voters.add("Bob")`     | ["Alice", "Bob"]    |
| `voters.add("Alice")`   | ["Alice", "Bob"]    |

---

## **3. Maps**
A **Map** is a collection that stores data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and a key maps to a single value.

### **Scenario**
You want to store and retrieve the phone numbers of people using their names as identifiers.

### **Key Features**
- **Key-Value Pair:** Each key maps to one value.
- **No Duplicate Keys:** Each key must be unique.

### **Example**
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, String> phoneBook = new HashMap<>();

        // Adding entries
        phoneBook.put("Alice", "123-456-7890");
        phoneBook.put("Bob", "987-654-3210");
        phoneBook.put("Alice", "111-222-3333");

        // Printing phone book
        System.out.println("Phone Book: " + phoneBook);

        // Accessing by key
        System.out.println("Alice's Phone: " + phoneBook.get("Alice"));
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run**
| Operation                      | Map Content                             |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `phoneBook.put("Alice", "123-456-7890")` | {"Alice"="123-456-7890"}          |
| `phoneBook.put("Bob", "987-654-3210")`   | {"Alice"="123-456-7890", "Bob"="987-654-3210"} |
| `phoneBook.put("Alice", "111-222-3333")` | {"Alice"="111-222-3333", "Bob"="987-654-3210"} |
| `phoneBook.get("Alice")`                | Outputs: "111-222-3333"           |

---

## Summary Table
| Feature               | List                   | Set                    | Map                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Duplicates Allowed    | Yes                    | No                     | Keys: No, Values: Yes        |
| Maintains Order       | Yes                    | No                     | No                          |
| Access by Index/Key   | By Index               | Not Applicable         | By Key                      |

# Sorting and Searching in Java

## Introduction
Sorting and searching are fundamental operations in computer science that allow you to organize data and retrieve specific information efficiently. These operations are crucial for improving the performance of algorithms and ensuring that data is processed in a way that minimizes time and space complexity.

- **Sorting**: Arranges elements in a particular order (e.g., ascending or descending).
- **Searching**: Locates a specific element within a dataset.

## What
Sorting and searching are two of the most widely used algorithms in software development. Sorting organizes a collection of elements, and searching is the process of finding specific elements within that collection. 

- **Sorting**: Can be done in ascending or descending order, and there are various sorting algorithms available, such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching**: Involves finding an element in a dataset. Popular searching algorithms include Linear Search and Binary Search.

## Why
Sorting and searching are essential for:
- **Efficiency**: Algorithms are often more efficient when the data is sorted. Searching in sorted data can be faster and less computationally expensive (e.g., Binary Search).
- **Optimization**: Many algorithms require sorted data as input to work efficiently (e.g., for implementing range queries or finding the median).
- **Problem Solving**: Many real-world problems require sorting or searching to solve them efficiently, such as searching for a specific record in a database or arranging elements in a specific order for a display or report.

## Where
Sorting and searching are commonly used in:
- **Databases**: For organizing records and performing efficient searches.
- **Web development**: Sorting user data or search results.
- **Data analysis**: Sorting data for analysis or finding specific entries in large datasets.
- **Algorithms and problem-solving**: In contests, interviews, and competitive programming challenges.

## When
You need to use sorting and searching when:
- **Sorting**: When you need to organize a dataset in a specific order (e.g., sorting a list of employees by their salaries).
- **Searching**: When you need to find an element in a dataset quickly (e.g., finding a specific product in an e-commerce platform).

## How

### Sorting in Java
In Java, sorting can be achieved using:
1. **Java Arrays.sort()**: The `Arrays.sort()` method provides a simple and fast way to sort arrays in Java.
   ```java
   int[] arr = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6};
   Arrays.sort(arr); // sorts the array in ascending order
   ```
2. **Collections.sort()**: If you have a list of objects, the Collections.sort() method can be used to sort them.
```
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6);
Collections.sort(list); // sorts the list in ascending order
```
In this document, we will explore multiple sorting and searching algorithms in Java, including their scenarios, code, and dry runs.

---

## Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.

#### Scenario
Imagine you have a list of students' scores and want to arrange them in ascending order to identify the lowest and highest scores.

#### Java Code
```java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] array) {
        int n = array.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap array[j] and array[j + 1]
                    int temp = array[j];
                    array[j] = array[j + 1];
                    array[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] scores = {45, 32, 88, 12, 67};

        System.out.println("Original Scores:");
        for (int score : scores) {
            System.out.print(score + " ");
        }

        bubbleSort(scores);

        System.out.println("\n\nSorted Scores:");
        for (int score : scores) {
            System.out.print(score + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Dry Run
Let’s sort the array `[45, 32, 88, 12, 67]` using Bubble Sort:

1. **Pass 1:**
   - Compare 45 and 32 → Swap → `[32, 45, 88, 12, 67]`
   - Compare 45 and 88 → No Swap
   - Compare 88 and 12 → Swap → `[32, 45, 12, 88, 67]`
   - Compare 88 and 67 → Swap → `[32, 45, 12, 67, 88]`

2. **Pass 2:**
   - Compare 32 and 45 → No Swap
   - Compare 45 and 12 → Swap → `[32, 12, 45, 67, 88]`
   - Compare 45 and 67 → No Swap

3. **Pass 3:**
   - Compare 32 and 12 → Swap → `[12, 32, 45, 67, 88]`
   - Compare 32 and 45 → No Swap

4. **Pass 4:**
   - Compare 12 and 32 → No Swap

Final sorted array: `[12, 32, 45, 67, 88]`

---

### 2. Selection Sort
Selection Sort divides the array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

#### Java Code
```java
public class SelectionSort {
    public static void selectionSort(int[] array) {
        int n = array.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int minIndex = i;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (array[j] < array[minIndex]) {
                    minIndex = j;
                }
            }
            // Swap array[i] and array[minIndex]
            int temp = array[minIndex];
            array[minIndex] = array[i];
            array[i] = temp;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] scores = {45, 32, 88, 12, 67};

        System.out.println("Original Scores:");
        for (int score : scores) {
            System.out.print(score + " ");
        }

        selectionSort(scores);

        System.out.println("\n\nSorted Scores:");
        for (int score : scores) {
            System.out.print(score + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Dry Run
Let’s sort the array `[45, 32, 88, 12, 67]` using Selection Sort:

1. **Pass 1:**
   - Find the smallest element (12) and swap it with the first element → `[12, 32, 88, 45, 67]`

2. **Pass 2:**
   - Find the smallest element (32) in the remaining array and swap → `[12, 32, 88, 45, 67]`

3. **Pass 3:**
   - Find the smallest element (45) in the remaining array and swap → `[12, 32, 45, 88, 67]`

4. **Pass 4:**
   - Find the smallest element (67) in the remaining array and swap → `[12, 32, 45, 67, 88]`

Final sorted array: `[12, 32, 45, 67, 88]`

---

### 3. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking an element and inserting it into its correct position.

#### Java Code
```java
public class InsertionSort {
    public static void insertionSort(int[] array) {
        int n = array.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int key = array[i];
            int j = i - 1;

            while (j >= 0 && array[j] > key) {
                array[j + 1] = array[j];
                j--;
            }
            array[j + 1] = key;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] scores = {45, 32, 88, 12, 67};

        System.out.println("Original Scores:");
        for (int score : scores) {
            System.out.print(score + " ");
        }

        insertionSort(scores);

        System.out.println("\n\nSorted Scores:");
        for (int score : scores) {
            System.out.print(score + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Dry Run
Let’s sort the array `[45, 32, 88, 12, 67]` using Insertion Sort:

1. **Pass 1:**
   - Insert 32 into its correct position → `[32, 45, 88, 12, 67]`

2. **Pass 2:**
   - Insert 88 into its correct position → `[32, 45, 88, 12, 67]`

3. **Pass 3:**
   - Insert 12 into its correct position → `[12, 32, 45, 88, 67]`

4. **Pass 4:**
   - Insert 67 into its correct position → `[12, 32, 45, 67, 88]`

Final sorted array: `[12, 32, 45, 67, 88]`

# Sorting Algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Built-in Sorting

## 1. Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

### **Algorithm Steps**
1. Divide the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sort each half.
3. Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted array.

### **Time Complexity**
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)

### **Code Example**
```java
public class MergeSort {
    public static void mergeSort(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
        if (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Recursively divide the array
            mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
            mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);

            // Merge the sorted halves
            merge(arr, left, mid, right);
        }
    }

    public static void merge(int[] arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
        int n1 = mid - left + 1;
        int n2 = right - mid;

        int[] L = new int[n1];
        int[] R = new int[n2];

        System.arraycopy(arr, left, L, 0, n1);
        System.arraycopy(arr, mid + 1, R, 0, n2);

        int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
        while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
            if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
                arr[k] = L[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                arr[k] = R[j];
                j++;
            }
            k++;
        }

        while (i < n1) {
            arr[k] = L[i];
            i++;
            k++;
        }

        while (j < n2) {
            arr[k] = R[j];
            j++;
            k++;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};
        mergeSort(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: ");
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run**
Input: `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]`

1. Split into `[12, 11, 13]` and `[5, 6, 7]`.
2. Further split into `[12]`, `[11, 13]`, `[5]`, and `[6, 7]`.
3. Sort and merge: `[11, 12, 13]` and `[5, 6, 7]`.
4. Final merge: `[5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13]`.

---

## 2. Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array around the pivot, ensuring elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and larger elements are on the right.

### **Algorithm Steps**
1. Select a pivot element.
2. Partition the array such that elements smaller than the pivot go to the left, and elements greater than the pivot go to the right.
3. Recursively apply the process to the left and right subarrays.

### **Time Complexity**
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n²) (when the pivot is the smallest or largest element)
- Average Case: O(n log n)

### **Code Example**
```java
public class QuickSort {
    public static void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

            quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    public static int partition(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = arr[high];
        int i = (low - 1);

        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
                i++;

                // Swap arr[i] and arr[j]
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
            }
        }

        // Swap arr[i+1] and pivot
        int temp = arr[i + 1];
        arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
        arr[high] = temp;

        return i + 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};
        quickSort(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: ");
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run**
Input: `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`

1. Select pivot = 5. Partition: `[1] | 5 | [10, 7, 8, 9]`.
2. Recur on `[1]` (already sorted).
3. Pivot = 9 in `[10, 7, 8, 9]`. Partition: `[7, 8] | 9 | [10]`.
4. Final sorted array: `[1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

---

## 3. Built-in Sorting

Java provides built-in methods for sorting arrays and collections using `Arrays.sort()` and `Collections.sort()`.

### **Advantages**
- Highly optimized and efficient.
- Supports primitive types (`int`, `double`, etc.) and objects (`String`, custom objects).

### **Code Example**
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class BuiltInSort {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sorting an array
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        Arrays.sort(arr);

        System.out.println("Sorted array: ");
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }

        // Sorting a collection
        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90);
        Collections.sort(list);

        System.out.println("\nSorted list: ");
        for (int num : list) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run**
Input: `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]`

1. Call `Arrays.sort()`.
2. Array after sorting: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`.
3. Call `Collections.sort()` on list: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`.

## Searching Algorithms

### 1. Linear Search
Linear Search sequentially checks each element of the array until the target element is found.

#### Java Code
```java
public class LinearSearch {
    public static int linearSearch(int[] array, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            if (array[i] == target) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] scores = {12, 32, 45, 67, 88};
        int target = 45;

        int index = linearSearch(scores, target);

        if (index != -1) {
            System.out.println("Score " + target + " found at index: " + index);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Score " + target + " not found.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Dry Run
Let’s search for `45` in `[12, 32, 45, 67, 88]`:

1. Compare 12 with 45 → Not Found
2. Compare 32 with 45 → Not Found
3. Compare 45 with 45 → Found at Index 2

---

### 2. Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm to find an element in a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half.

#### Java Code
```java
public class BinarySearch {
    public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = array.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (array[mid] == target) {
                return mid; // Target found
            }

            if (array[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1; // Search the right half
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // Search the left half
            }
        }

        return -1; // Target not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] scores = {12, 32, 45, 67, 88};
        int target = 45;

        int index = binarySearch(scores, target);

        if (index != -1) {
            System.out.println("Score " + target + " found at index: " + index);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Score " + target + " not found.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Dry Run
Let’s search for `45` in `[12, 32, 45, 67, 88]`:

1. **Step 1:**
   - Low = 0, High = 4, Mid = (0 + 4) / 2 = 2
   - Array[Mid] = 45 → Target Found at Index 2

---

## Conclusion
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort are basic techniques to organize data.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Linear Search and Binary Search are useful to locate data efficiently.

By mastering these techniques, you can solve many practical problems in computer science and programming.

# Exception Handling in Java

## What is Exception Handling?
Exception Handling is a mechanism in Java to handle runtime errors, ensuring the normal flow of a program. It helps manage unexpected events and prevents the program from crashing.

---

## Why is Exception Handling Important?
1. **Prevents Crashes**: Avoids abrupt program termination.
2. **Improves Debugging**: Makes it easier to identify and fix issues.
3. **Enhances Readability**: Separates error-handling code from the main logic.

---

## Key Terminology
1. **Exception**: An event that disrupts the normal flow of the program (e.g., division by zero, file not found).
2. **Try Block**: Code that might throw an exception is enclosed in a `try` block.
3. **Catch Block**: Handles the exception.
4. **Finally Block**: Executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred.
5. **Throw**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
6. **Throws**: Declares exceptions that a method can throw.

---

## Basic Example: Divide by Zero
### Code
```java
public class BasicExceptionHandling {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an exception
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Execution completed.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Output
```
Error: Cannot divide by zero.
Execution completed.
```
---

## Real-Time Scenario: File Reading
Imagine a program that reads data from a file. If the file does not exist, an exception occurs.

### Code
```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileReader file = new FileReader("data.txt");
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(file);
            System.out.println(reader.readLine());
            reader.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: File not found.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Problem reading the file.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finished file operation.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Output (if the file does not exist)
```
Error: File not found.
Finished file operation.
```

---

## Advanced Concepts

### 1. **Custom Exceptions**
You can create your own exceptions by extending the `Exception` class.

#### Code Example
```java
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class CustomExceptionExample {
    static void validateAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or above.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age is valid.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            validateAge(16);
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Output
```
Exception: Age must be 18 or above.
```

---

### 2. **Multi-Catch Block**
A `try` block can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

#### Code Example
```java
public class MultiCatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] arr = new int[3];
            System.out.println(arr[5]); // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Arithmetic Exception occurred.");
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Array Index Out of Bounds Exception occurred.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Some other exception occurred.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Output
```
Array Index Out of Bounds Exception occurred.
```

---

### 3. **Throws Keyword**
Used to declare exceptions that a method can throw.

#### Code Example
```java
public class ThrowsExample {
    static void checkFile() throws IOException {
        FileReader file = new FileReader("data.txt");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            checkFile();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: File operation failed.");
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Best Practices
1. **Use Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions rather than a generic `Exception` class.
2. **Avoid Empty Catch Blocks**: Always log or handle the exception.
3. **Use Finally for Cleanup**: Close resources (e.g., files, database connections) in the `finally` block.
4. **Don’t Suppress Exceptions**: Ensure exceptions are logged or re-thrown.

---

## Real-Time Applications of Exception Handling
1. **Banking Applications**: Handle insufficient balance exceptions.
2. **E-commerce Platforms**: Handle payment failures or product unavailability.
3. **Web Applications**: Manage server-side errors or user input validations.

---

## Summary
Exception Handling ensures robust and error-tolerant applications. It separates normal logic from error-handling logic, making code cleaner and more maintainable. By mastering exception handling, you can create reliable Java programs that gracefully handle unexpected situations.

# File I/O: Reading from and Writing to Files

## What is File I/O?

File Input/Output, or File I/O, is the process of interacting with files stored on your computer. In programming, this typically means:

1. **Input (Reading)**: Extracting or loading data from a file into your program.
2. **Output (Writing)**: Sending or saving data from your program into a file.

Imagine files as digital notebooks. If you want to use the information in the notebook, you need to open it, read it, and close it. Similarly, if you want to add notes to the notebook, you must open it, write on it, and close it.

---

## Why is File I/O Important?

File I/O helps developers store and retrieve data effectively. Here's why it's essential:

1. **Data Persistence**  
   Without File I/O, your program's data disappears when it stops running. File I/O ensures data is stored permanently.  
   _Example_: Saving user preferences or game progress.

2. **Data Sharing**  
   Files are a universal way to share data between applications. For instance, one program can generate a report as a file, and another program can read it.  
   _Example_: Exporting data as a CSV file for Excel or a JSON file for APIs.

3. **Large-Scale Data Handling**  
   Files allow you to work with vast amounts of data that cannot be stored in the computer's memory (RAM).  
   _Example_: Reading a large log file or writing thousands of records to a database backup file.

---

## When and Where is File I/O Used?

File I/O is used in virtually every real-world application. Here are some relatable use cases:

1. **Web Development**  
   - Saving and retrieving configuration settings.  
   - Storing logs of user activities.  
   _Example_: A blog platform storing articles in files before publishing.

2. **Gaming**  
   - Saving checkpoints, high scores, or inventory lists.  
   _Example_: A chess game saving the board state so you can resume later.

3. **Banking Applications**  
   - Generating monthly bank statements as PDF files.  
   - Storing transaction logs securely.  
   _Example_: Exporting transaction history as a CSV file.

4. **Scientific Research**  
   - Reading large datasets from files for processing.  
   - Writing simulation results to files for further analysis.  
   _Example_: A weather forecasting system storing daily temperature data.

5. **Desktop Applications**  
   - Text editors like Notepad use File I/O to load and save documents.  
   _Example_: MS Word saving your document as a `.docx` file.

---

## Understanding File I/O Workflow

The basic workflow of working with files can be divided into **three main steps**:

1. **Open the File**  
   Decide what you want to do with the file:  
   - **Read** data from it.  
   - **Write** new data to it.  
   - **Append** data to it without deleting the existing content.

   _Example_:  
   ```java
   import java.io.File;
    import java.io.FileReader;
    import java.io.BufferedReader;
   import java.io.IOException;

   class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("example.txt"); // Ensure this file exists in your working directory
        BufferedReader bufferedReader = null;

        try {
            // Open the file with BufferedReader for efficient reading
            bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
            String line;

            // Read and print each line from the file
            while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle exception if file not found or cannot be read
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            try {
                // Close the reader to release resources
                if (bufferedReader != null) {
                    bufferedReader.close();
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("Failed to close reader: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
     }


   ```
   ### Explanation and Elaboration:

#### **File Object Creation (`File file = new File("example.txt");`)**:
- In Java, you create a `File` object to represent the file you want to work with. This object points to the file `"example.txt"` on your system. You need to create this object first before you can read or write to the file.

#### **Opening the File (`FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(file);`)**:
- To read the file, you use a `FileReader`. This class is used to read text files, meaning it reads the content as characters.

- You create the `FileReader` by passing the `File` object to it. If the file doesn't exist, or there’s an issue opening it, Java will throw an error called `IOException`.

#### **Exception Handling**:
- In Java, you have to handle any errors (exceptions) that might happen when working with files, like the file not being found.

- `IOException` is an error that you must either catch in your code or declare that your method could cause it. You can catch it using a `try-catch` block.

#### **Closing the File (`fileReader.close();`)**:
- In Java, you must manually close the file when you're done with it. This is important to avoid any memory or resource problems. You do this in the `finally` block, which ensures it happens even if an error occurs while working with the file.

#### **Why Use `FileReader`**:
- Use `FileReader` when reading text files. If you need to work with files that contain other types of data, like images or videos, you would use `FileInputStream` instead.

   


2. **Perform File Operations**  
   Use appropriate methods to read, write, or append data.

   _Example (Reading)_:  
   ```java
   content = file.read()  # Read the file's content
   print(content)import java.io.File;
   import java.io.FileReader;
   import java.io.BufferedReader;
   import java.io.IOException;

   public class ReadFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("example.txt");  // Specify the file to read
        BufferedReader reader = null;

        try {
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));  // Create a BufferedReader to read the file
            String content;
            while ((content = reader.readLine()) != null) {  // Read the file line by line
                System.out.println(content);  // Print each line
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());  // Handle any errors
        } finally {
            try {
                if (reader != null) {
                    reader.close();  // Ensure the BufferedReader is closed after use
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("An error occurred while closing the file: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
    }

   ```
   ### Explanation:

#### **FileReader**:
- The `FileReader` class is used to read the content of a file character by character. It provides a basic way to read text files in Java.

#### **BufferedReader**:
- The `BufferedReader` class is used to read the file line by line, which is more efficient when working with text files. It reads large chunks of data into a buffer, then processes it line by line using the `readLine()` method. This improves performance compared to reading the file character by character.

#### **IOException**:
- `IOException` is an exception that occurs if there are issues while reading the file, such as the file not being found or read errors. In Java, file-related exceptions must be handled using a `try-catch` block to ensure that the program can recover from such errors gracefully.

#### **Finally Block**:
- The `finally` block ensures that resources such as file readers are properly closed after use, even if an error occurs. This prevents resource leaks and ensures that the file is properly released back to the operating system.


   _Example (Writing)_:  
   ```java
   import java.io.File;
   import java.io.FileWriter;
   import java.io.IOException;

  public class WriteToFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("example.txt");  // Specify the file to write to
        FileWriter writer = null;

        try {
            writer = new FileWriter(file, true);  // Create a FileWriter object in append mode
            writer.write("This is new content.\n");  // Write new content to the file
            System.out.println("Content written to file.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());  // Handle any I/O errors
        } finally {
            try {
                if (writer != null) {
                    writer.close();  // Close the FileWriter to free resources
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("An error occurred while closing the file: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
     }

   ```
   ### Explanation and Elaboration:

#### **File Object Creation (`File file = new File("example.txt");`)**:
- In this step, we create a `File` object that represents the file we intend to write to. The `File` object points to `"example.txt"`, which is the target file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created when we attempt to write to it.
- Unlike other programming languages that open files directly, Java requires an explicit `File` object to interact with the file system.

#### **FileWriter (`FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file, true);`)**:
- The `FileWriter` class is used for writing character-based data to a file. In this case, we initialize it with the `File` object that points to `"example.txt"`.
- The second parameter `true` is passed to the `FileWriter` constructor, which tells Java to open the file in *append mode*. This ensures that any new data written to the file will be added to the end of the file, rather than overwriting existing content.
- If we omit this parameter or set it to `false`, the file will be overwritten each time we write to it.

#### **Writing Data to the File (`writer.write("This is new content.\n");`)**:
- Here, we use the `write()` method of the `FileWriter` class to add data to the file. This method writes the specified string to the file.
- The string `"This is new content.\n"` is written into the file, and the newline character (`\n`) ensures that the content is placed on a new line.

#### **IOException Handling**:
- `IOException` is a type of exception that may occur during file operations, such as if the file cannot be opened, written to, or closed properly.
- Since these file operations involve external systems (the file system), Java requires us to handle any potential errors using a `try-catch` block.
- In this case, if any error occurs while writing to the file, the program will catch the exception and print an error message. This prevents the program from crashing unexpectedly.

#### **Finally Block (`finally { ... }`)**:
- The `finally` block is used to ensure that certain actions are performed after the `try-catch` block has completed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
- In this case, we use the `finally` block to close the `FileWriter` object. This is important because if the file is not closed properly, it could lead to resource leaks, meaning the file might not be released back to the operating system for other processes to use.
- Closing the `FileWriter` ensures that all buffered data is flushed to the file, and the resources are freed.

#### **FileWriter vs. Other Methods**:
- `FileWriter` is used for writing text data to a file. If binary data (e.g., images) needed to be written, Java provides classes like `FileOutputStream`.
- Additionally, using `BufferedWriter` in conjunction with `FileWriter` can improve performance by buffering the data before writing it to the file, reducing the number of I/O operations.

### Why This Approach is Important:
- This approach ensures that data is written to the file in a controlled and efficient manner. Using append mode helps maintain the integrity of the existing data, while exception handling guarantees that potential errors are managed effectively.
- Closing the `FileWriter` properly ensures that no resources are left open, preventing potential resource leaks that could affect the performance of the application.


3. **Close the File**  
   Closing the file ensures system resources are freed up and changes are saved.

   _Example_:  
   ```java
   writer.close();  // Close the FileWriter or BufferedWriter to free resources

   ```
### Explanation:

#### **close() method**:
- The `close()` method is used to release any system resources associated with the file or stream (such as the `FileWriter` or `BufferedWriter` in Java). 
- When working with files or streams, data is often buffered in memory before it is actually written to the file. Calling the `close()` method ensures that any remaining data in the buffer is flushed (written) to the file.
- Additionally, it closes the file or stream, releasing the file handle back to the operating system. This allows other processes or programs to access the file without any conflicts.

#### **Resource Management**:
- The `close()` method is essential in Java to prevent **resource leaks**. If a file or stream is not closed properly, it could cause various problems such as:
  - **File locks**: Other processes may not be able to access the file because it remains open.
  - **Memory issues**: Not closing streams properly can lead to excessive memory usage, as system resources are not released.
  
- Properly managing resources like file handles is critical for ensuring the smooth functioning of the application and for maintaining system performance.

## File Modes

When opening a file, you specify a **mode** to tell the program how to interact with it. Here are common modes:

| Mode  | Description                                  |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| `r`   | Read-only mode (default).                    |
| `w`   | Write mode. Overwrites the file if it exists.|
| `a`   | Append mode. Adds data to the end of the file.|
| `r+`  | Read and write mode.                         |
| `wb`  | Write mode for binary files (e.g., images).  |

# Understanding the Scanner Class in Java

The **Scanner** class in Java is like a tool that helps you take input from the user. It’s useful when your program needs to interact with people by asking questions or getting information, like numbers, words, or entire sentences.

## How to Use the Scanner Class

### Step 1: Import the Scanner Class
Before using the Scanner, you need to import it at the top of your program:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

### Step 2: Create a Scanner Object
To start using the Scanner, you need to create an object:
```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```
Here, `System.in` tells the Scanner to read input from the keyboard.

### Step 3: Read Input
The Scanner can read different types of data using specific methods:

- **String (sentence or word):**
  - `nextLine()` – Reads a full line of text.
  - `next()` – Reads a single word.

- **Numbers:**
  - `nextInt()` – Reads an integer.
  - `nextDouble()` – Reads a decimal number.
  - `nextFloat()` – Reads a floating-point number.
  - `nextLong()` – Reads a long integer.

- **Boolean:**
  - `nextBoolean()` – Reads `true` or `false` values.

### Example Code
Here’s a complete example to demonstrate different data types:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Reading a string
        System.out.println("What is your name?");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        // Reading an integer
        System.out.println("How old are you?");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        // Reading a decimal number
        System.out.println("What is your height in meters?");
        double height = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Reading a boolean
        System.out.println("Do you like programming? (true/false)");
        boolean likesProgramming = scanner.nextBoolean();

        // Display the user's input
        System.out.println("\nSummary of Input:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Height: " + height + " meters");
        System.out.println("Likes Programming: " + likesProgramming);

        // Close the Scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Output Example
When you run the program, it might look like this:
```
What is your name?
John
How old are you?
25
What is your height in meters?
1.75
Do you like programming? (true/false)
true

Summary of Input:
Name: John
Age: 25
Height: 1.75 meters
Likes Programming: true
```

### Important Notes
1. **Always Close the Scanner:**
   - Use `scanner.close()` when you're done to free up resources.

2. **Beware of Mixing `nextLine()` and Other Methods:**
   - If you use `nextInt()` or similar methods before `nextLine()`, you might need to clear the input buffer with an extra `scanner.nextLine()`.

### Fun Analogy
Think of the Scanner as a **conversation partner**. You ask questions, and it patiently waits for the user to answer before moving to the next step.

---

With the Scanner class, your programs can become interactive and dynamic, making them more fun to use!

## Scenarios and Examples

### Scenario 1: Writing a Simple Diary

You are creating a digital diary where users can add daily notes. When the user types their entry, it is saved in a text file.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class WriteDiaryEntry {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("diary.txt");  // Specify the file to write to
        FileWriter writer = null;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        try {
            writer = new FileWriter(file, true);  // Create a FileWriter object in append mode
            System.out.print("Write your diary entry: ");
            String entry = scanner.nextLine();  // Take input from the user
            writer.write(entry + "\n");  // Append the entry to the file
            System.out.println("Your entry has been saved!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());  // Handle any I/O errors
        } finally {
            try {
                if (writer != null) {
                    writer.close();  // Close the FileWriter to free resources
                }
                scanner.close();  // Close the scanner
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("An error occurred while closing the file: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}

```
### Explanation:

#### **FileWriter**:
- The `FileWriter` class is used to write characters to a file. In this example, the file `"diary.txt"` is specified for writing.
- We use `FileWriter(file, true)` to enable **append mode**. The `true` argument ensures that new entries are added to the end of the file rather than overwriting existing content.
- If the file doesn't exist, `FileWriter` will create it automatically.

#### **Scanner**:
- The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user. In this case, it captures the diary entry typed by the user.
- `scanner.nextLine()` reads the full line of text entered by the user.

#### **Exception Handling**:
- A `try-catch` block is used to handle potential `IOException`, which can occur if there are issues with the file, such as permission problems or the file not being found.
- The `catch` block catches the exception and prints an error message if any issues arise while opening or writing to the file.

#### **Finally Block**:
- The `finally` block ensures that the `FileWriter` and `Scanner` objects are closed properly, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
- **Closing the `FileWriter`** is necessary to flush any remaining data to the file and to release system resources. If not closed properly, it could cause resource leaks.
- **Closing the `Scanner`** is also important to release the system resource it holds for reading input.

#### **Append Mode**:
- In append mode (`true` parameter), each new entry is added at the end of the file rather than overwriting the existing content, which is ideal for diary or log files.

By using these components together, we allow the user to input their diary entry, write it to the file, and handle any potential file-related errors while ensuring proper resource management.
---

1. **Open the file** in append (`a`) mode to avoid overwriting existing entries.
2. **Write the user's input** to the file, adding a newline character for formatting.
3. **Close the file automatically** using the `with` statement.

---

### Scenario 2: Reading a Shopping List

Suppose you are building an app that reads and displays a user’s shopping list from a file.

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("shopping_list.txt"))) {
            String line;
            System.out.println("Your Shopping List:");
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println("- " + line.trim());  // Remove extra spaces or newline
            }
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```
### Explanation:

#### **BufferedReader**:
- The `BufferedReader` class is used to read the contents of a file line by line. It's more efficient than reading character-by-character because it reads large chunks of data into a buffer and processes it line by line.
- In this example, we use a `BufferedReader` to read the `shopping_list.txt` file.

#### **FileReader**:
- The `FileReader` class is used to read character-based files. It takes the path of the file as an argument and returns a `FileReader` object.
- `BufferedReader` is wrapped around the `FileReader` to improve the efficiency of reading lines from the file.

#### **Try-With-Resources**:
- The try-with-resources statement ensures that resources such as `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` are automatically closed at the end of the try block. 
- This eliminates the need for manually closing the stream and ensures that resources are released, preventing memory leaks.

#### **Reading the File**:
- The `readLine()` method of `BufferedReader` is used to read the file line by line. Each line is stored in the variable `line`.
- If the line is not null (meaning there's content in the file), it is printed to the console after trimming any extra spaces or newlines using `line.trim()`.

#### **Exception Handling**:
- `FileNotFoundException` is thrown if the file `shopping_list.txt` does not exist. The `catch` block handles this and prints "File not found!".
- `IOException` is a broader exception that could be thrown if any issues occur during reading the file (e.g., issues with file access permissions). The stack trace is printed if this exception occurs.

#### **Why Use `BufferedReader`**:
- `BufferedReader` improves performance when reading large files by reading large chunks of data at once, as opposed to reading one character at a time with `FileReader`.
- It also provides a convenient way to read the file line by line, making it ideal for processing text-based files.

#### **Output**:
- The program outputs each item in the shopping list, prepended with a dash (`-`), showing the user their list item by item.
- If the file is empty, nothing will be printed, but no error will occur.

By using `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` in this example, the program efficiently reads and displays each line of the shopping list from the file.

---

1. Use the `try` block to handle cases where the file doesn’t exist.
2. Read all lines into a list and display them with formatting.
3. Remove unwanted newline characters using `.strip()`.

---

### Scenario 3: Logging User Activities

Imagine an application that logs every time a user logs in. The log file grows over time, and new entries are always added at the end.

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter your username: ");
        String username = scanner.nextLine();
        
        LocalDateTime timestamp = LocalDateTime.now();
        DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
        String formattedTimestamp = timestamp.format(formatter);
        
        try (PrintWriter logFile = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("user_logs.txt", true))) {
            logFile.println(username + " logged in at " + formattedTimestamp);
            System.out.println("Your activity has been logged.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```
### Explanation:

#### **Scanner**:
- The `Scanner` class is used to capture input from the user. In this program, it's used to prompt the user for their username.
- The `nextLine()` method reads the entire line entered by the user, which is then stored in the `username` variable.

#### **LocalDateTime**:
- The `LocalDateTime` class is used to obtain the current date and time. The `now()` method returns the current date and time from the system clock.
- This class allows you to handle date and time without worrying about time zones, making it useful for recording timestamps.

#### **DateTimeFormatter**:
- The `DateTimeFormatter` class is used to format the `LocalDateTime` object into a human-readable string.
- In this example, the format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` is used to display the date and time in the format: year-month-day hours:minutes:seconds.

#### **FileWriter and PrintWriter**:
- `FileWriter` is used to write raw data to a file. It takes the file name and the append flag (`true`) as arguments, which ensures that new log entries are added to the existing file instead of overwriting it.
- `PrintWriter` is used to write text to the file in a more convenient way, especially for adding formatted output like strings and newline characters. It's wrapped around the `FileWriter` to allow easier printing of text.

#### **Try-With-Resources**:
- The try-with-resources statement is used to automatically close the `PrintWriter` (and the underlying `FileWriter`) after the operation is completed. This ensures that the file resource is properly closed, even if an exception occurs.
- Resources like file streams need to be closed to free up system resources and prevent memory leaks.

#### **Logging User Activity**:
- The program logs the user’s username and the current timestamp in a file named `user_logs.txt`. Each log entry contains the username and the time they logged in.
- The entry is written in the format: `"username logged in at timestamp"`. For example: `john_doe logged in at 2024-12-31 10:30:45`.

#### **Exception Handling**:
- If any I/O errors occur (such as file access issues), they are caught by the `IOException` catch block. In this case, the exception's stack trace is printed to help debug the issue.

#### **Why Use `PrintWriter`**:
- `PrintWriter` simplifies writing text to a file compared to other classes like `FileWriter`, as it provides methods such as `println()` which automatically handles line breaks.

#### **Program Flow**:
1. The user is prompted to enter their username.
2. The current date and time are captured and formatted.
3. The program appends the login information (username and timestamp) to `user_logs.txt`.
4. If successful, the user is informed that their activity has been logged.

This program efficiently captures and logs user activity in a text file, allowing for easy tracking of logins along with timestamps.

----

1. **Capture the current time** using `datetime.datetime.now()`.
2. **Append the log** entry to the file with the username and timestamp.
3. This approach ensures that older logs are preserved.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use the `with` Statement**  
   - It automatically closes the file after usage, even if an error occurs.  
   - Example:  
     ```java
     import java.io.File;
     import java.io.FileReader;
     import java.io.BufferedReader;
     import java.io.IOException;

     public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedReader reader = null;
        try {
            File file = new File("example.txt");
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
            StringBuilder data = new StringBuilder();
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                data.append(line).append("\n");
            }
            // Now, data contains the file content
            System.out.println(data.toString());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            try {
                if (reader != null) {
                    reader.close();
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
      }
     }

     ```
     ### Explanation:

#### **File Creation (`new File("example.txt")`)**:
- A `File` object is created using the file name `"example.txt"`. This represents the file to be read. The file should exist in the working directory, or an exception will occur if it's not found.

#### **BufferedReader and FileReader**:
- `FileReader` is used to read the file character by character. It takes a `File` object as an argument, which specifies the file to be read.
- `BufferedReader` is wrapped around the `FileReader` to read text more efficiently. It buffers the data to improve reading performance, especially when dealing with larger files. The `readLine()` method is used to read the file line by line, which is more memory-efficient than reading the entire file at once.

#### **Reading the File**:
- A `StringBuilder` is used to store the content of the file. It efficiently appends strings, as `StringBuilder` is mutable and avoids creating new strings for each append operation.
- The program reads each line of the file using `readLine()`. If there are more lines in the file, it appends the line to the `StringBuilder`. Each line is followed by a newline character (`\n`) to preserve the file’s structure.
  
#### **Exception Handling**:
- The `try-catch` block is used to handle potential `IOException` exceptions. This could occur if the file doesn't exist, if there are issues reading the file, or if there are other I/O-related problems. If an error occurs, it will be caught in the `catch` block, and `e.printStackTrace()` will display the details of the error.

#### **Closing Resources**:
- The `finally` block ensures that the `BufferedReader` is closed after reading the file. Closing resources is essential to free up system resources and avoid memory leaks.
- `reader.close()` is called to release the file handle. If closing the reader fails, the error is caught in the inner `catch` block.

#### **Program Flow**:
1. A `File` object is created for `"example.txt"`.
2. A `BufferedReader` is instantiated with a `FileReader` to read the file.
3. The file is read line by line, and each line is appended to a `StringBuilder`.
4. After reading the file, the contents are printed to the console.
5. In the `finally` block, the `BufferedReader` is safely closed to release system resources.

This program is a simple example of reading a file, storing its content, and handling potential I/O errors. It ensures that resources are properly managed by using the `finally` block for closing the file reader.
----

2. **Error Handling**  
   - Handle common errors like `FileNotFoundError` to make your program robust.  
   - Example:  
     ```java
     import java.io.File;
     import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
     import java.util.Scanner;

     public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("nonexistent.txt");
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);
            String content = scanner.useDelimiter("\\A").next();
            scanner.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found!");
        }
     }
     }

     ```
     ### Explanation:

#### **File Creation (`new File("nonexistent.txt")`)**:
- A `File` object is created using the file name `"nonexistent.txt"`. This `File` object represents the file that the program will attempt to read. If the file doesn't exist, it will lead to a `FileNotFoundException`.

#### **Scanner Class**:
- The `Scanner` class is used to read the contents of the file. In this case, the `Scanner` is created with the `File` object as its input.
- The `useDelimiter("\\A")` method tells the `Scanner` to treat the entire file as a single token. The delimiter `"\\A"` matches the beginning of the input, meaning the whole content is considered as one token. The `next()` method is used to fetch the entire content of the file as a string.

#### **Exception Handling**:
- The `try-catch` block is used to handle the potential `FileNotFoundException`. If the file `"nonexistent.txt"` does not exist in the specified path, the exception will be thrown, and the program will enter the `catch` block.
- In the `catch` block, a message is printed: `"File not found!"`, indicating that the file could not be located.

#### **Closing the Scanner**:
- The `scanner.close()` method is used to close the `Scanner` object after reading the file content. Closing resources is important to avoid resource leaks, especially when working with input/output operations.

#### **Program Flow**:
1. A `File` object for `"nonexistent.txt"` is created.
2. A `Scanner` is instantiated to read the contents of the file.
3. The `useDelimiter("\\A")` method makes the `Scanner` treat the entire file as a single token and fetch its content using the `next()` method.
4. If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundException` is thrown, and the `catch` block prints `"File not found!"`.
5. The `Scanner` object is closed in the `finally` block (not shown here, but recommended for good practice).

#### **Key Points**:
- **FileNotFoundException** is a checked exception, meaning it must be handled either by catching it or declaring it in the method signature.
- The `Scanner` is used to read the file, and its content is read into a string using the delimiter `"\\A"`.
- It's important to close the `Scanner` after use to release system resources.

This program attempts to read the content of a file and handles the case where the file does not exist.

3. **Keep Files Organized**  
   - Store files in dedicated folders (e.g., `logs/`, `data/`) to keep your project neat.

# Multithreading in Java: A Comprehensive Guide

## What is Multithreading?
Multithreading is a Java feature that allows the concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently and shares the same memory space. It is especially useful in scenarios where multiple tasks need to run simultaneously, such as processing large datasets, running background tasks, or managing user interactions in a GUI application.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Process vs. Thread:**
   - A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space.
   - A thread is a smaller unit within a process, sharing the same memory but running independently.

2. **Concurrency:** Refers to the ability to run multiple tasks in overlapping time periods.
3. **Parallelism:** Refers to the simultaneous execution of tasks, typically on multi-core processors.

## Why Use Multithreading?
### Benefits:
1. **Improved Performance:** Tasks are executed in parallel, reducing total execution time.
2. **Efficient CPU Utilization:** Even when one thread is waiting (e.g., for I/O), other threads can run, keeping the CPU busy.
3. **Asynchronous Behavior:** Tasks like file I/O or network operations can run without blocking the main thread.
4. **Enhanced User Experience:** For GUI-based applications, multithreading ensures responsiveness by offloading time-consuming operations to background threads.

---

## Threads in Java
In Java, a thread is an object that encapsulates a single sequential flow of control within a program. Java provides two primary ways to create and manage threads:
1. Extending the `Thread` class.
2. Implementing the `Runnable` interface.

---

## Life Cycle of a Thread
A thread in Java undergoes the following states during its lifecycle:
1. **New:** The thread is created using the `Thread` class but hasn’t started execution yet.
2. **Runnable:** The thread is ready to run but is waiting for CPU allocation by the thread scheduler.
3. **Running:** The thread is actively executing.
4. **Blocked/Waiting:** The thread is waiting for a resource or another thread to complete its task.
5. **Terminated:** The thread has finished execution.

### Diagram:
The thread life cycle can be visualized with the following diagram:
```
 New ---> Runnable ---> Running ---> Terminated
            |                 ^
            v                 |
      Blocked/Waiting --------
```

## How to Create a Thread in Java

### Method 1: Extending the `Thread` Class
In this approach, a class extends the `Thread` class and overrides its `run()` method to define the thread’s behavior.

#### Code Example:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Pauses the thread for 1 second
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start(); // Start the thread

        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. The `MyThread` class extends the `Thread` class and overrides the `run()` method to define the task to be executed.
2. The `start()` method is called to begin the execution of the thread. Internally, this calls the `run()` method.
3. The `Thread.sleep(1000)` pauses the thread for 1 second, simulating a time-consuming operation.

### Method 2: Implementing the `Runnable` Interface
In this approach, a class implements the `Runnable` interface and defines the thread’s task in the `run()` method.

#### Code Example:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();

        Thread t2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. The `MyRunnable` class implements the `Runnable` interface and overrides the `run()` method.
2. A `Thread` object is created by passing an instance of `MyRunnable` to its constructor.
3. The `start()` method is called on the `Thread` object to execute the task defined in the `run()` method.

### Comparison:
- Use `Runnable` when the class needs to extend another class (since Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance).
- Use `Thread` when simplicity is preferred, and no other inheritance is needed.

---

## Key Methods of the `Thread` Class
1. **`start()`**: Starts the thread and calls the `run()` method.
2. **`run()`**: Contains the code to be executed by the thread.
3. **`sleep(milliseconds)`**: Pauses the thread for the specified time.
4. **`join()`**: Waits for a thread to finish before continuing.
5. **`isAlive()`**: Checks if a thread is still running.
6. **`setPriority(int priority)`**: Sets the thread’s priority (values range from `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` to `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY`).
7. **`getName()` / `setName(String name)`**: Gets/Sets the thread’s name.

---

## Thread Synchronization
Synchronization ensures that only one thread accesses a critical section of code at a time, preventing data inconsistency.

### Example: Synchronized Block
```java
class SharedResource {
    public void printNumbers() {
        synchronized (this) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread {
    SharedResource resource;

    MyThread(SharedResource resource) {
        this.resource = resource;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        resource.printNumbers();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Thread t1 = new MyThread(resource);
        Thread t2 = new MyThread(resource);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The `synchronized` block ensures that only one thread executes the `printNumbers` method at a time, preventing interference.
- Without synchronization, the threads may interleave their execution, leading to inconsistent results.

---

## Inter-Thread Communication
Inter-thread communication is essential when threads need to coordinate their actions.

### Example Using `wait()` and `notify()`:
```java
class SharedResource {
    private boolean flag = false;

    synchronized void produce() {
        while (flag) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Produced");
        flag = true;
        notify();
    }

    synchronized void consume() {
        while (!flag) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Consumed");
        flag = false;
        notify();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                resource.produce();
            }
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                resource.consume();
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. The `produce` method waits if `flag` is true and signals the consumer when production is complete.
2. The `consume` method waits if `flag` is false and signals the producer after consumption.
3. `wait()` releases the lock and pauses the thread until `notify()` is called by another thread.

---

## Thread Pooling
Thread pooling avoids the overhead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly by reusing a fixed number of threads.

### Example Using `ExecutorService`:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            executor.execute(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " running on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. The `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3)` creates a thread pool with three threads.
2. The `execute` method assigns tasks to the threads in the pool.
3. The `shutdown()` method ensures no new tasks are accepted, and the existing tasks complete.

---

## Common Issues in Multithreading
1. **Deadlock:** Occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other indefinitely.
2. **Race Condition:** Happens when threads access shared data simultaneously, causing unpredictable behavior.
3. **Starvation:** Occurs when low-priority threads are perpetually denied CPU time.

---

## Best Practices
1. Use thread pools for better resource management.
2. Synchronize critical sections to avoid race conditions.
3. Minimize the use of `Thread.sleep()` as it’s not precise.
4. Prefer high-level concurrency APIs (e.g., `java.util.concurrent`) for better scalability

## **1. What is Multithreading?**

Multithreading is a feature in Java that allows a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is the smallest unit of a process, capable of running independently. By utilizing multithreading, Java can handle multiple tasks simultaneously within a single program.

### **Key Terminology:**
- **Thread:** A single sequence of execution within a program.
- **Multithreading:** The ability to run multiple threads simultaneously to perform different tasks.
- **Concurrency:** Performing multiple tasks at overlapping times, improving overall performance.

---

## **2. Why Use Multithreading?**

- **Improved Performance:** Tasks execute faster since threads work in parallel.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Makes the best use of CPU by keeping it busy with multiple threads.
- **Responsiveness:** Ideal for GUI applications, where one thread manages the interface while others perform background tasks.
- **Scalability:** Helps in handling multiple clients or requests simultaneously, such as in a server environment.

---

## **3. When to Use Multithreading?**

- Tasks are independent and can run in parallel.
- Applications requiring faster execution, such as:
  - **Web servers** to handle multiple user requests.
  - **Games** to manage animations, physics, and input simultaneously.
  - **Data processing** to read, write, and analyze data concurrently.

---

## **4. Where is Multithreading Used?**

- **Backend systems:** To process simultaneous user requests.
- **Banking applications:** Managing concurrent transactions like deposits and withdrawals.
- **Real-time systems:** Flight booking systems, online trading platforms, etc.
- **Chat applications:** Handling multiple chat sessions in real-time.
- **Multimedia applications:** Concurrently handling video rendering, audio processing, and user interactions.

---

## **5. How to Implement Multithreading in Java?**

In Java, multithreading can be implemented in two primary ways:
1. **Extending the `Thread` class.**
2. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface.**

---

## **Examples: From Basic to Advanced**

### **Basic Example: Extending the `Thread` Class**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running: " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();

        thread1.start(); // Starts thread1
        thread2.start(); // Starts thread2
    }
}
```
### Explanation:

#### **MyThread Class**:
- The `MyThread` class extends the `Thread` class, which means it is a custom thread that can be executed concurrently with other threads.
- Inside the `MyThread` class, the `run()` method is overridden. The `run()` method contains the code that will be executed when the thread is started.
- In this case, the `run()` method prints the current thread's name and a counter value (from 1 to 5), demonstrating that each thread runs independently.

#### **Main Class**:
- The `Main` class contains the `main()` method, which is the entry point of the program.
  
#### **Thread Creation and Execution**:
1. Two instances of `MyThread` are created:
   - `MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();`
   - `MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();`
   
2. `thread1.start();` and `thread2.start();` are called. The `start()` method is used to begin the execution of the thread. When the `start()` method is called:
   - A new thread is created, and the `run()` method is executed concurrently with other threads. 
   - This is a non-blocking operation, meaning the main thread can continue executing without waiting for `thread1` or `thread2` to finish.

#### **Thread Behavior**:
- The `run()` method is executed in parallel for both threads. For each thread, the loop will print the following output (with `thread1` and `thread2` potentially interleaving):
---

### **Intermediate Example: Implementing `Runnable`**

```java
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running task: " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyTask());
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyTask());

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```
### Explanation:

#### **MyTask Class**:
- The `MyTask` class implements the `Runnable` interface, which means it can be used to define tasks that can be executed by a thread. 
- The `run()` method is overridden from the `Runnable` interface. This method contains the task that will be executed by the thread.
- Inside the `run()` method, there is a loop that prints the current thread’s name and the task count (from 1 to 5). This demonstrates how each thread runs its own instance of the task.

#### **Main Class**:
- The `Main` class contains the `main()` method, which is the entry point for the program.

#### **Thread Creation and Execution**:
1. **Creating Threads**:
   - Instead of directly extending the `Thread` class like in the previous example, here, two `Thread` objects are created by passing an instance of `MyTask` to the `Thread` constructor:
     ```java
     Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyTask());
     Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyTask());
     ```
     This approach uses the `Runnable` interface, allowing more flexibility as it decouples the task from the thread itself, meaning you can reuse the same task (`MyTask`) with different threads.
   
2. **Starting Threads**:
   - The `start()` method is called on both `thread1` and `thread2` to begin their execution:
     ```java
     thread1.start();
     thread2.start();
     ```
     This initiates the execution of the `run()` method in each thread, allowing both threads to run concurrently.

#### **Thread Behavior**:
- Both `thread1` and `thread2` will run concurrently, executing the `run()` method of `MyTask`. The output will look something like this (but the exact order may vary because the threads are running in parallel):
----

### **Advanced Example: Multithreading in a Banking Scenario**

Imagine a bank where two users are withdrawing money from the same account at the same time.

```java
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;

    public synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is withdrawing: " + amount);
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Remaining balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance for " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}

class WithdrawTask implements Runnable {
    private BankAccount account;
    private int amount;

    public WithdrawTask(BankAccount account, int amount) {
        this.account = account;
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    public void run() {
        account.withdraw(amount);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        Thread user1 = new Thread(new WithdrawTask(account, 700), "User1");
        Thread user2 = new Thread(new WithdrawTask(account, 500), "User2");

        user1.start();
        user2.start();
    }
}
```
### Explanation:

#### **BankAccount Class**:
- The `BankAccount` class represents a bank account with a private instance variable `balance`, initialized to `1000`.
- The `withdraw()` method is synchronized to ensure that only one thread can execute it at a time for a particular instance of `BankAccount`. This is done using the `synchronized` keyword, which prevents race conditions (multiple threads trying to modify the balance at the same time).
  
  - **Withdrawal Process**: If the account has enough balance (i.e., `balance >= amount`), the thread proceeds to withdraw the specified amount and updates the balance. It prints the amount being withdrawn and the remaining balance.
  - **Insufficient Balance**: If the account balance is insufficient, the thread prints a message indicating that there is not enough money for the withdrawal.

#### **WithdrawTask Class**:
- The `WithdrawTask` class implements the `Runnable` interface, which means its `run()` method can be executed by a thread.
- The `run()` method simply calls the `withdraw()` method of the `BankAccount` object with the specified withdrawal amount.

#### **Main Class**:
- The `Main` class contains the `main()` method, which is the entry point of the program.
  
  - **Creating BankAccount Object**: A `BankAccount` object named `account` is created, which is shared by both threads.
  - **Creating Threads**:
    - Two threads (`user1` and `user2`) are created, each representing a user attempting to withdraw a certain amount from the shared bank account.
    - `user1` is trying to withdraw `700`, while `user2` is trying to withdraw `500`.
    - Both threads are given distinct names ("User1" and "User2") to identify them in the output.
  - **Starting Threads**: The `start()` method is called on both threads to begin their execution. This triggers the `run()` method of each thread, which in turn calls the `withdraw()` method of `BankAccount`.

#### **Thread Synchronization**:
- The `withdraw()` method is synchronized, which means that only one thread can access it at any given time. This ensures that even if multiple threads attempt to withdraw money concurrently, the balance will be updated safely without any race conditions.
  
  - For example, if `User1` is withdrawing money and `User2` tries to withdraw at the same time, `User2` will have to wait until `User1` has finished its withdrawal. This ensures that the balance is correctly updated without interference.

#### **Execution Flow**:
1. **Thread Execution**:
   - `User1` tries to withdraw `700`. If there is enough balance, the withdrawal will proceed, and the remaining balance will be printed.
   - After `User1` finishes, `User2` will attempt to withdraw `500` from the same bank account. If the balance is still sufficient, `User2`'s withdrawal will proceed.

2. **Output**:
   - The output will vary depending on the timing of thread execution. However, the following sequence is possible:
     ```
     User1 is withdrawing: 700
     Remaining balance: 300
     User2 is withdrawing: 500
     Insufficient balance for User2
     ```
     This shows that `User1` successfully withdrew `700`, leaving a balance of `300`, and `User2` couldn't withdraw `500` due to insufficient balance.

#### **Key Points**:
- **Synchronized Method**: The `withdraw()` method is synchronized to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety when multiple threads access the same resource (the bank account balance).
- **Runnable Interface**: `WithdrawTask` implements `Runnable` so that each withdrawal attempt is a separate task that can be executed by different threads.
- **Thread Behavior**: By starting multiple threads (`user1` and `user2`), we simulate concurrent withdrawal attempts on the same bank account.
- **Thread Interference**: Without synchronization, threads might interfere with each other, leading to incorrect updates to the balance. The use of the `synchronized` keyword prevents this.

#### **Summary**:
This program simulates a bank account where two users try to withdraw money concurrently. It demonstrates the use of thread synchronization in Java to safely handle shared resources (like a bank account balance) and prevent race conditions. By synchronizing the `withdraw()` method, we ensure that only one thread can modify the balance at a time, guaranteeing correct behavior even when multiple threads are involved.

## **Real-Time Scenario: Video Streaming Application**

### **Scenario:**
A video streaming service requires concurrent handling of different tasks:
1. Fetching video data from the server.
2. Rendering the video on the screen.
3. Listening to user inputs (play, pause, rewind).

### **Code Implementation:**

```java
class FetchData extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Fetching video data...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate data fetching
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Video data fetched.");
    }
}

class RenderVideo extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Rendering video...");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("Frame " + i + " rendered.");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Simulate frame rendering
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

class UserInputHandler extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Listening to user inputs...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(10000); // Simulate user input handling
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("User inputs processed.");
    }
}

public class VideoStreamingApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FetchData fetchThread = new FetchData();
        RenderVideo renderThread = new RenderVideo();
        UserInputHandler inputThread = new UserInputHandler();

        fetchThread.start();
        renderThread.start();
        inputThread.start();
    }
}
```
### Explanation of the Video Streaming App Using Threads in Java

#### **Overview**:
This program simulates a video streaming application where three distinct tasks are handled by different threads:
1. **Fetching video data**.
2. **Rendering video frames**.
3. **Listening to and processing user inputs**.

The tasks are performed concurrently using threads, which allows these operations to run simultaneously, improving the responsiveness and performance of the application.

---

#### **Classes and Threads**:

1. **`FetchData` Class**:
   - Inherits from `Thread` and overrides the `run()` method to simulate the process of fetching video data.
   - The method prints `"Fetching video data..."` and then simulates a delay of 2 seconds (`Thread.sleep(2000)`) to mimic fetching data from a server or database.
   - After the delay, it prints `"Video data fetched."`.

   **Purpose**: This thread simulates the process of loading or fetching video data from an external source (e.g., a server or database).

2. **`RenderVideo` Class**:
   - Inherits from `Thread` and overrides the `run()` method to simulate video rendering.
   - The method prints `"Rendering video..."` and then enters a loop where it simulates rendering 10 frames of video. For each frame, it prints `"Frame i rendered."`, with `i` being the frame number.
   - After each frame is rendered, the thread pauses for 500 milliseconds (`Thread.sleep(500)`) to simulate the time required to render each frame.

   **Purpose**: This thread simulates rendering the video frames one by one, which could be the process of drawing each frame onto a screen or preparing it for playback.

3. **`UserInputHandler` Class**:
   - Inherits from `Thread` and overrides the `run()` method to simulate handling user inputs.
   - The method prints `"Listening to user inputs..."` and then simulates a 10-second delay (`Thread.sleep(10000)`) to represent the time taken for listening and processing user inputs (e.g., play, pause, or skip).
   - After the delay, it prints `"User inputs processed."`.

   **Purpose**: This thread simulates listening for user input and processing commands, such as controlling video playback.

---

#### **`VideoStreamingApp` Class**:
- The `main()` method initializes three thread objects:
  - `fetchThread` of type `FetchData`.
  - `renderThread` of type `RenderVideo`.
  - `inputThread` of type `UserInputHandler`.
- These threads are started by calling the `start()` method on each thread object. This triggers the execution of the `run()` method for each thread concurrently.

---

#### **Thread Execution**:
When the program runs:
- All three threads (`fetchThread`, `renderThread`, `inputThread`) start executing concurrently:
  - **`fetchThread`** will simulate fetching video data for 2 seconds.
  - **`renderThread`** will start rendering frames, and each frame rendering is delayed by 500 milliseconds.
  - **`inputThread`** will simulate waiting for and processing user inputs for 10 seconds.
  
As the threads are running concurrently, the output can vary in order depending on which thread completes its task first. The outputs from all threads will be interleaved.

For example, the output might look like:
----

### **Explanation:**
- **FetchData Thread:** Simulates retrieving video data from the server.
- **RenderVideo Thread:** Continuously renders frames of the video.
- **UserInputHandler Thread:** Handles user actions like play, pause, and rewind.

By running these threads concurrently, the application ensures seamless streaming, rendering, and user interaction.

---

## **Key Concepts to Teach**

### **Thread Lifecycle:**
1. **New:** Thread is created but not started.
2. **Runnable:** Thread is ready to run but waiting for CPU time.
3. **Running:** Thread is executing.
4. **Blocked/Waiting:** Thread is waiting for a resource.
5. **Terminated:** Thread has completed execution.

### **Thread Safety:**
- Use `synchronized` blocks or methods to avoid data inconsistencies in shared resources.

### **Thread Priorities:**
- Threads can have priorities (1 to 10). Higher priority threads are preferred by the scheduler but are not guaranteed execution.

### **Concurrency Utilities:**
- Explore `java.util.concurrent` package for advanced tools like:
  - **Thread Pools:** Efficient thread management using `ExecutorService`.
  - **CountDownLatch:** Synchronize threads until a condition is met.
  - **Semaphore:** Control access to shared resources.

---

## **Conclusion**

Multithreading in Java is a powerful tool for building high-performance, responsive, and scalable applications. By understanding its concepts and applying them to real-world scenarios, developers can leverage concurrency effectively to solve complex problems.
